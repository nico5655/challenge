It is guaranteed that during the $$$m+1$$$-th try you press all buttons right and finally perform the combo.I.e. if $$$s=$$$\"abca\", $$$m=2$$$ and $$$p = [1, 3]$$$ then the sequence of pressed buttons will be 'a' (here you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), 'a', 'b', 'c', (here you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), 'a' (note that at this point you will not perform the combo because of the mistake), 'b', 'c', 'a'.Your task is to calculate for each button (letter) the number of times you'll press it.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
