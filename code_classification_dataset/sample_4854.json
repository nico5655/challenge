    "prob_desc_description": "You are given three arrays $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. Initially, array $$$a$$$ consists of $$$n$$$ elements, arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are empty.You are performing the following algorithm that consists of two steps:   Step $$$1$$$: while $$$a$$$ is not empty, you take the last element from $$$a$$$ and move it in the middle of array $$$b$$$. If $$$b$$$ currently has odd length, you can choose: place the element from $$$a$$$ to the left or to the right of the middle element of $$$b$$$. As a result, $$$a$$$ becomes empty and $$$b$$$ consists of $$$n$$$ elements.  Step $$$2$$$: while $$$b$$$ is not empty, you take the middle element from $$$b$$$ and move it to the end of array $$$c$$$. If $$$b$$$ currently has even length, you can choose which of two middle elements to take. As a result, $$$b$$$ becomes empty and $$$c$$$ now consists of $$$n$$$ elements.  Refer to the Note section for examples.Can you make array $$$c$$$ sorted in non-decreasing order?",

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6$$$) — the array $$$a$$$ itself.
