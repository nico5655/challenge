Athlete $$$1$$$ is superior to athlete $$$2$$$. Indeed athlete $$$1$$$ ranks better than athlete $$$2$$$ in the marathons $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$.  Athlete $$$2$$$ is superior to athlete $$$3$$$. Indeed athlete $$$2$$$ ranks better than athlete $$$3$$$ in the marathons $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$.

Explanation of the third test case: There are $$$n=3$$$ athletes.   Athlete $$$1$$$ is superior to athletes $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$. Since he is superior to all other athletes, he is likely to get the gold medal.  Athlete $$$2$$$ is superior to athlete $$$3$$$.  Athlete $$$3$$$ is not superior to any other athlete.
