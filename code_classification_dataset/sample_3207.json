There should be exactly one $$$k$$$-decker on the field, i. e. a ship that is $$$k$$$ cells long oriented either horizontally or vertically. However, Arkady doesn't know where it is located. For each cell Arkady knows if it is definitely empty or can contain a part of the ship.Consider all possible locations of the ship. Find such a cell that belongs to the maximum possible number of different locations of the ship.",
