The $$$i$$$-th member has a height of $$$a_i$$$ millimeters.It's the end of the school year and Sayaka wants to take a picture of all other members of the student council. Being the hard-working and perfectionist girl as she is, she wants to arrange all the members in a line such that the amount of photogenic consecutive pairs of members is as large as possible.A pair of two consecutive members $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ on a line is considered photogenic if their average height is an integer, i.e. $$$\\frac{a_u + a_v}{2}$$$ is an integer.Help Sayaka arrange the other members to maximize the number of photogenic consecutive pairs.",
