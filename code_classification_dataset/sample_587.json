The languages are numbered with integers from 1 to m. For each employee we have the list of languages, which he knows. This list could be empty, i. e. an employee may know no official languages. But the employees are willing to learn any number of official languages, as long as the company pays their lessons. A study course in one language for one employee costs 1 berdollar.Find the minimum sum of money the company needs to spend so as any employee could correspond to any other one (their correspondence can be indirect, i. e. other employees can help out translating).",

Next, the i-th line contains ki integers — aij (1 ≤ aij ≤ m) — the identifiers of languages the i-th employee knows. It is guaranteed that all the identifiers in one list are distinct. Note that an employee may know zero languages. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.",
