Sum of all elements in his array should be equal to $$$S$$$. Then Petya has to select an integer $$$K$$$ such that $$$0 \\leq K \\leq S$$$.In order to win, Vasya has to find a non-empty subarray in Petya's array such that the sum of all selected elements equals to either $$$K$$$ or $$$S - K$$$. Otherwise Vasya loses.You are given integers $$$N$$$ and $$$S$$$. You should determine if Petya can win, considering Vasya plays optimally. If Petya can win, help him to do that.",

The array should contain $$$N$$$ positive integers with sum equal to $$$S$$$. In the third line print $$$K$$$. If there are many correct answers, you can print any of them. If Petya can't win, print \"NO\" (without quotes). You can print each letter in any register (lowercase or uppercase).",
