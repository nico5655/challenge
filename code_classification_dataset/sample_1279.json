    "prob_desc_description": "Ichihime is the current priestess of the Mahjong Soul Temple. She claims to be human, despite her cat ears.These days the temple is holding a math contest. Usually, Ichihime lacks interest in these things, but this time the prize for the winner is her favorite — cookies. Ichihime decides to attend the contest. Now she is solving the following problem. You are given four positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$, such that $$$a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d$$$. Your task is to find three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$, satisfying the following conditions: $$$a \\leq x \\leq b$$$. $$$b \\leq y \\leq c$$$. $$$c \\leq z \\leq d$$$. There exists a triangle with a positive non-zero area and the lengths of its three sides are $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$.Ichihime desires to get the cookie, but the problem seems too hard for her. Can you help her?",
