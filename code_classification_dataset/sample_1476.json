    "prob_desc_description": "Phoenix is picking berries in his backyard. There are $$$n$$$ shrubs, and each shrub has $$$a_i$$$ red berries and $$$b_i$$$ blue berries.Each basket can contain $$$k$$$ berries. But, Phoenix has decided that each basket may only contain berries from the same shrub or berries of the same color (red or blue). In other words, all berries in a basket must be from the same shrub or/and have the same color.For example, if there are two shrubs with $$$5$$$ red and $$$2$$$ blue berries in the first shrub and $$$2$$$ red and $$$1$$$ blue berries in the second shrub then Phoenix can fill $$$2$$$ baskets of capacity $$$4$$$ completely:   the first basket will contain $$$3$$$ red and $$$1$$$ blue berries from the first shrub;  the second basket will contain the $$$2$$$ remaining red berries from the first shrub and $$$2$$$ red berries from the second shrub. Help Phoenix determine the maximum number of baskets he can fill completely!",
