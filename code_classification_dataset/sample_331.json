This time he won't show them any set from his large collection, but will ask them to create a new set to replenish his beautiful collection of sets.Dr. Evil has his favorite evil integer x. He asks Mahmoud and Ehab to find a set of n distinct non-negative integers such the bitwise-xor sum of the integers in it is exactly x. Dr. Evil doesn't like big numbers, so any number in the set shouldn't be greater than 106.",
