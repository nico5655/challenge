    "prob_desc_description": "You are given a permutation $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ numbers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$n$$$ (a permutation is an array in which each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once).You can perform the following operation: choose some subarray (contiguous subsegment) of $$$a$$$ and rearrange the elements in it in any way you want. But this operation cannot be applied to the whole array.For example, if $$$a = [2, 1, 4, 5, 3]$$$ and we want to apply the operation to the subarray $$$a[2, 4]$$$ (the subarray containing all elements from the $$$2$$$-nd to the $$$4$$$-th), then after the operation, the array can become $$$a = [2, 5, 1, 4, 3]$$$ or, for example, $$$a = [2, 1, 5, 4, 3]$$$.Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations described above to sort the permutation $$$a$$$ in ascending order.",
