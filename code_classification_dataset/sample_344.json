    "prob_desc_description": "Amugae has a sentence consisting of $$$n$$$ words. He want to compress this sentence into one word. Amugae doesn't like repetitions, so when he merges two words into one word, he removes the longest prefix of the second word that coincides with a suffix of the first word. For example, he merges \"sample\" and \"please\" into \"samplease\".Amugae will merge his sentence left to right (i.e. first merge the first two words, then merge the result with the third word and so on). Write a program that prints the compressed word after the merging process ends.",
