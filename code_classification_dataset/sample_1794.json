    "prob_desc_description": "Polycarp has guessed three positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order — their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: $$$a+b$$$, $$$a+c$$$, $$$b+c$$$ and $$$a+b+c$$$.You have to guess three numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.Pay attention that some given numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ can be equal (it is also possible that $$$a=b=c$$$).",

Print $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.",
