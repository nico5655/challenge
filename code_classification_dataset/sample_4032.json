    "prob_desc_description": "Alice has just learned addition. However, she hasn't learned the concept of \"carrying\" fully — instead of carrying to the next column, she carries to the column two columns to the left.For example, the regular way to evaluate the sum $$$2039 + 2976$$$ would be as shown:   However, Alice evaluates it as shown:   In particular, this is what she does:   add $$$9$$$ and $$$6$$$ to make $$$15$$$, and carry the $$$1$$$ to the column two columns to the left, i. e. to the column \"$$$0$$$ $$$9$$$\";  add $$$3$$$ and $$$7$$$ to make $$$10$$$ and carry the $$$1$$$ to the column two columns to the left, i. e. to the column \"$$$2$$$ $$$2$$$\";  add $$$1$$$, $$$0$$$, and $$$9$$$ to make $$$10$$$ and carry the $$$1$$$ to the column two columns to the left, i. e. to the column above the plus sign;  add $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ to make $$$5$$$;  add $$$1$$$ to make $$$1$$$.  Thus, she ends up with the incorrect result of $$$15005$$$.Alice comes up to Bob and says that she has added two numbers to get a result of $$$n$$$. However, Bob knows that Alice adds in her own way. Help Bob find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers such that when Alice adds them, she will get a result of $$$n$$$. Note that pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ and $$$(b, a)$$$ are considered different if $$$a \\ne b$$$.",
