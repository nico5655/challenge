    "prob_desc_description": "Sereja has a sequence that consists of n positive integers, a1, a2, ..., an. First Sereja took a piece of squared paper and wrote all distinct non-empty non-decreasing subsequences of sequence a. Then for each sequence written on the squared paper, Sereja wrote on a piece of lines paper all sequences that do not exceed it.A sequence of positive integers x = x1, x2, ..., xr doesn't exceed a sequence of positive integers y = y1, y2, ..., yr, if the following inequation holds: x1 ≤ y1, x2 ≤ y2, ..., xr ≤ yr.Now Sereja wonders, how many sequences are written on the lines piece of paper. Help Sereja, find the required quantity modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). ",
