Changes of direction will take place before moving from the fifth to the second computer, then from the second to the third computer, then from the third to the first computer.In the third sample the optimal order of collecting parts from computers can look like that: 1-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;6-&gt;2-&gt;5-&gt;7.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Robot Doc is located in the hall, with n computers stand in a line, numbered from left to right from 1 to n. Each computer contains exactly one piece of information, each of which Doc wants to get eventually. The computers are equipped with a security system, so to crack the i-th of them, the robot needs to collect at least ai any pieces of information from the other computers. Doc can hack the computer only if he is right next to it.The robot is assembled using modern technologies and can move along the line of computers in either of the two possible directions, but the change of direction requires a large amount of resources from Doc. Tell the minimum number of changes of direction, which the robot will have to make to collect all n parts of information if initially it is next to computer with number 1.It is guaranteed that there exists at least one sequence of the robot's actions, which leads to the collection of all information. Initially Doc doesn't have any pieces of information.",
