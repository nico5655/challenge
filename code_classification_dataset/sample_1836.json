    "prob_desc_description": "You have a list of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ written from left to right on the blackboard.You perform an algorithm consisting of several steps (steps are $$$1$$$-indexed). On the $$$i$$$-th step you wipe the $$$i$$$-th number (considering only remaining numbers). You wipe the whole number (not one digit).  When there are less than $$$i$$$ numbers remaining, you stop your algorithm. Now you wonder: what is the value of the $$$x$$$-th remaining number after the algorithm is stopped?",

All queries are independent. Each line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le x &lt; n \\le 10^{9}$$$) — the length of the list and the position we wonder about. It's guaranteed that after the algorithm ends, the list will still contain at least $$$x$$$ numbers.",
