    "prob_desc_description": "You are given $$$n$$$ dominoes. Each domino has a left and a right cell. Each cell can be colored either black or white. Some cells are already colored, while some aren't yet.The coloring is said to be valid if and only if it is possible to rearrange the dominoes in some order such that for each $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$ the color of the right cell of the $$$i$$$-th domino is different from the color of the left cell of the $$$((i \\bmod n)+1)$$$-st domino. Note that you can't rotate the dominoes, so the left cell always remains the left cell, and the right cell always remains the right cell.Count the number of valid ways to color the yet uncolored cells of dominoes. Two ways are considered different if there is a cell that is colored white in one way and black in the other. In particular, colorings BW WB and WB BW different (and both invalid).As this number can be very big, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",

Character B means that the corresponding cell is black, character W means that the corresponding cell is white, and ? means that the cell is yet to be colored. ",
