For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$), Pak Chanek will write the one-element set $$$\\{a_i\\}$$$ on a whiteboard.After that, in one operation, Pak Chanek may do the following:   Choose two different sets $$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$ on the whiteboard such that $$$S \\cap T = \\varnothing$$$ ($$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$ do not have any common elements).  Erase $$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$ from the whiteboard and write $$$S \\cup T$$$ (the union of $$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$) onto the whiteboard. After performing zero or more operations, Pak Chanek will construct a multiset $$$M$$$ containing the sizes of all sets written on the whiteboard. In other words, each element in $$$M$$$ corresponds to the size of a set after the operations.How many distinct$$$^\\dagger$$$ multisets $$$M$$$ can be created by this process? Since the answer may be large, output it modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.$$$^\\dagger$$$ Multisets $$$B$$$ and $$$C$$$ are different if and only if there exists a value $$$k$$$ such that the number of elements with value $$$k$$$ in $$$B$$$ is different than the number of elements with value $$$k$$$ in $$$C$$$.",
