So, you can't place any white domino, since there is only one white cell.In the second test case, the board of the same size $$$2 \\times 1$$$, but both cell are white. Since $$$w = 0$$$ and $$$b = 0$$$, so you can place $$$0 + 0 = 0$$$ dominoes on the board.In the third test case, board $$$2 \\times 3$$$, but fully colored in black (since $$$k_1 = k_2 = 0$$$), so you can't place any white domino.In the fourth test case, cells $$$(1, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 3)$$$, and $$$(2, 1)$$$ are white and other cells are black. You can place $$$2$$$ white dominoes at positions $$$((1, 1), (2, 1))$$$ and $$$((1, 2), (1, 3))$$$ and $$$2$$$ black dominoes at positions $$$((1, 4), (2, 4))$$$ $$$((2, 2), (2, 3))$$$.",
