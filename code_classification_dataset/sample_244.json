So the answer is either $$$[3,1]$$$ or $$$[3,2,1]$$$. Since we want the subsequence to be as short as possible, the answer is $$$[3,1]$$$.",

Among all such subsequences, choose the one whose length, $$$k$$$, is as small as possible. If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deleting some (possibly, zero or all) elements.A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array of length $$$n$$$ in which every element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once.",
