    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteThe first two test cases in the example correspond to the first two jumps from the point $$$x_0 = 0$$$. Since $$$0$$$ is an even number, the first jump of length $$$1$$$ is made to the left, and the grasshopper ends up at the point $$$0 - 1 = -1$$$.Then, since $$$-1$$$ is an odd number, a jump of length $$$2$$$ is made to the right, bringing the grasshopper to the point with coordinate $$$-1 + 2 = 1$$$.",
    "prob_desc_description": "The grasshopper is located on the numeric axis at the point with coordinate $$$x_0$$$.Having nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points on the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate $$$x$$$ with a distance $$$d$$$ to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate $$$x - d$$$, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate $$$x + d$$$.The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer $$$i$$$ starting with $$$1$$$ the following holds: exactly $$$i$$$ minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly $$$i$$$. So, in the first minutes he jumps by $$$1$$$, then by $$$2$$$, and so on.The direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right.For example, if after $$$18$$$ consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate $$$7$$$, he will jump by a distance of $$$19$$$ to the right, since $$$7$$$ is an odd number, and will end up at a point $$$7 + 19 = 26$$$. Since $$$26$$$ is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of $$$20$$$, and it will move him to the point $$$26 - 20 = 6$$$.Find exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly $$$n$$$ jumps.",
