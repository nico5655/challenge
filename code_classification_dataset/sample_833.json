Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains x potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes (x + y) in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than n, and, secondly, was divisible by k.Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.",
