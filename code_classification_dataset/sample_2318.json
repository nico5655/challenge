Each of the t-shirts is characterized by three integers pi, ai and bi, where pi is the price of the i-th t-shirt, ai is front color of the i-th t-shirt and bi is back color of the i-th t-shirt. All values pi are distinct, and values ai and bi are integers from 1 to 3.m buyers will come to the shop. Each of them wants to buy exactly one t-shirt. For the j-th buyer we know his favorite color cj.A buyer agrees to buy a t-shirt, if at least one side (front or back) is painted in his favorite color. Among all t-shirts that have colors acceptable to this buyer he will choose the cheapest one. If there are no such t-shirts, the buyer won't buy anything. Assume that the buyers come one by one, and each buyer is served only after the previous one is served.You are to compute the prices each buyer will pay for t-shirts.",
