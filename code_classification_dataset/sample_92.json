    "prob_desc_description": "Dreamoon is a big fan of the Codeforces contests.One day, he claimed that he will collect all the places from $$$1$$$ to $$$54$$$ after two more rated contests. It's amazing!Based on this, you come up with the following problem:There is a person who participated in $$$n$$$ Codeforces rounds. His place in the first round is $$$a_1$$$, his place in the second round is $$$a_2$$$, ..., his place in the $$$n$$$-th round is $$$a_n$$$.You are given a positive non-zero integer $$$x$$$.Please, find the largest $$$v$$$ such that this person can collect all the places from $$$1$$$ to $$$v$$$ after $$$x$$$ more rated contests.In other words, you need to find the largest $$$v$$$, such that it is possible, that after $$$x$$$ more rated contests, for each $$$1 \\leq i \\leq v$$$, there will exist a contest where this person took the $$$i$$$-th place.For example, if $$$n=6$$$, $$$x=2$$$ and $$$a=[3,1,1,5,7,10]$$$ then answer is $$$v=5$$$, because if on the next two contest he will take places $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, then he will collect all places from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$, so it is possible to get $$$v=5$$$.",
