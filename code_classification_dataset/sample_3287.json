This way Vasya has 1, 2, 3, 4 and 0 unread messages at the corresponding minutes, he gets 40 points for them. When reading messages, he receives (5 - 4·3) + (5 - 3·3) + (5 - 2·3) + (5 - 1·3) + 5 =  - 5 points. This is 35 in total.",
    "prob_desc_description": "There are n incoming messages for Vasya. The i-th message is going to be received after ti minutes. Each message has a cost, which equals to A initially. After being received, the cost of a message decreases by B each minute (it can become negative). Vasya can read any message after receiving it at any moment of time. After reading the message, Vasya's bank account receives the current cost of this message. Initially, Vasya's bank account is at 0.Also, each minute Vasya's bank account receives C·k, where k is the amount of received but unread messages.Vasya's messages are very important to him, and because of that he wants to have all messages read after T minutes.Determine the maximum amount of money Vasya's bank account can hold after T minutes.",
