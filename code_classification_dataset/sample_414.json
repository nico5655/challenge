Now they are moving into a dormitory. George and Alex want to live in the same room. The dormitory has n rooms in total. At the moment the i-th room has pi people living in it and the room can accommodate qi people in total (pi ≤ qi). Your task is to count how many rooms has free place for both George and Alex.",
