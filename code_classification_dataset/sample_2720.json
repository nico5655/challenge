Alyona is very choosy — she doesn't take a leaf if it matches the color and the species of the tree of one of the leaves she already has. Find out how many leaves Alyona has picked.",

Each leaf is characterized by the species of the tree it has fallen from and by the color. The species of the trees and colors are given in names, consisting of no more than 10 lowercase Latin letters. A name can not be an empty string. The species of a tree and the color are given in each line separated by a space.",
