In the second game, if you will ask pair $$$(0, 0)$$$, the answer will be \"x\" (without quotes), because $$$(0 \\bmod 2) \\geq (0 \\bmod 2)$$$. But if you will ask pair $$$(2, 5)$$$, the answer will be \"y\" (without quotes), because $$$(2 \\bmod 2) &lt; (5 \\bmod 2)$$$, because $$$(2 \\bmod 2) = 0$$$ and $$$(5 \\bmod 2) = 1$$$.",
    "prob_desc_description": "This is an interactive problem.Vasya and Petya are going to play the following game: Petya has some positive integer number $$$a$$$. After that Vasya should guess this number using the following questions. He can say a pair of non-negative integer numbers $$$(x, y)$$$. Petya will answer him:   \"x\", if $$$(x \\bmod a) \\geq (y \\bmod a)$$$.  \"y\", if $$$(x \\bmod a) &lt; (y \\bmod a)$$$. We define $$$(x \\bmod a)$$$ as a remainder of division $$$x$$$ by $$$a$$$.Vasya should guess the number $$$a$$$ using no more, than 60 questions.It's guaranteed that Petya has a number, that satisfies the inequality $$$1 \\leq a \\leq 10^9$$$.Help Vasya playing this game and write a program, that will guess the number $$$a$$$.",
