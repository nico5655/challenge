For example, if $$$n = 27$$$ and $$$k = 3$$$ you can do the following steps: $$$27 \\rightarrow 26 \\rightarrow 25 \\rightarrow 24 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 0$$$.You are asked to calculate the minimum number of steps to reach $$$0$$$ from $$$n$$$.
