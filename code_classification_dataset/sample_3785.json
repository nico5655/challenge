    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case, $$$24$$$ is generated as follows:  $$$1$$$ is in this set, so $$$3$$$ and $$$6$$$ are in this set;  $$$3$$$ is in this set, so $$$9$$$ and $$$8$$$ are in this set;  $$$8$$$ is in this set, so $$$24$$$ and $$$13$$$ are in this set. Thus we can see $$$24$$$ is in this set.The five smallest elements of the set in the second test case is described in statements. We can see that $$$10$$$ isn't among them.",
    "prob_desc_description": "There is an infinite set generated as follows:  $$$1$$$ is in this set.  If $$$x$$$ is in this set, $$$x \\cdot a$$$ and $$$x+b$$$ both are in this set. For example, when $$$a=3$$$ and $$$b=6$$$, the five smallest elements of the set are:  $$$1$$$,  $$$3$$$ ($$$1$$$ is in this set, so $$$1\\cdot a=3$$$ is in this set),  $$$7$$$ ($$$1$$$ is in this set, so $$$1+b=7$$$ is in this set),  $$$9$$$ ($$$3$$$ is in this set, so $$$3\\cdot a=9$$$ is in this set),  $$$13$$$ ($$$7$$$ is in this set, so $$$7+b=13$$$ is in this set). Given positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$n$$$, determine if $$$n$$$ is in this set.",
