    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteConsider the first sample. For the pair $$$\\{2, 5\\}$$$, the situation looks as follows, with the Arrayland markers at $$$|2| = 2$$$ and $$$|5| = 5$$$, while the Vectorland markers are located at $$$|2 - 5| = 3$$$ and $$$|2 + 5| = 7$$$:  The legend is not true in this case, because the interval $$$[2, 3]$$$ is not conquered by Vectorland. For the pair $$$\\{5, -3\\}$$$ the situation looks as follows, with Arrayland consisting of the interval $$$[3, 5]$$$ and Vectorland consisting of the interval $$$[2, 8]$$$:  As Vectorland completely contains Arrayland, the legend is true. It can also be shown that the legend is true for the pair $$$\\{2, -3\\}$$$, for a total of two pairs.In the second sample, the only pair is $$$\\{3, 6\\}$$$, and the situation looks as follows:  Note that even though Arrayland and Vectorland share $$$3$$$ as endpoint, we still consider Arrayland to be completely inside of Vectorland.",
    "prob_desc_description": "The legend of the foundation of Vectorland talks of two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points $$$|x|$$$ and $$$|y|$$$ on the number line and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years later, the vector king placed markers at points $$$|x - y|$$$ and $$$|x + y|$$$ and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of Arrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of Vectorland.Here $$$|z|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$z$$$.Now, Jose is stuck on a question of his history exam: \"What are the values of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$?\" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the possible answers down to $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. Now, he wants to know the number of unordered pairs formed by two different elements from these $$$n$$$ integers such that the legend could be true if $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible that Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.",
