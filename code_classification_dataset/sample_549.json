You shouldn't print any extra empty lines during the interaction process.In the first test $$$n=10$$$ and $$$x=4$$$.Initially the set is: $$$\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\}$$$.In the first operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$4$$$ and delete them. The answer is $$$2$$$ because there are two numbers divisible by $$$4$$$: $$$\\{4,8\\}$$$. $$$8$$$ will be deleted but $$$4$$$ won't, because the number $$$x$$$ will never be deleted. Now the set is $$$\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10\\}$$$.In the second operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$2$$$. The answer is $$$4$$$ because there are four numbers divisible by $$$2$$$: $$$\\{2,4,6,10\\}$$$.In the third operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$8$$$. The answer is $$$0$$$ because there isn't any number divisible by $$$8$$$ in the current set.In the fourth operation, you know that $$$x=4$$$, which is the right answer.",
    "prob_desc_description": "This is an interactive problem.There is an unknown integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\le x\\le n$$$). You want to find $$$x$$$.At first, you have a set of integers $$$\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$$$. You can perform the following operations no more than $$$10000$$$ times:  A $$$a$$$: find how many numbers are multiples of $$$a$$$ in the current set.  B $$$a$$$: find how many numbers are multiples of $$$a$$$ in this set, and then delete all multiples of $$$a$$$, but $$$x$$$ will never be deleted (even if it is a multiple of $$$a$$$). In this operation, $$$a$$$ must be greater than $$$1$$$.  C $$$a$$$: it means that you know that $$$x=a$$$. This operation can be only performed once. Remember that in the operation of type B $$$a&gt;1$$$ must hold.Write a program, that will find the value of $$$x$$$.",
