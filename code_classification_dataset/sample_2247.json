    "prob_desc_description": "You are the gym teacher in the school.There are $$$n$$$ students in the row. And there are two rivalling students among them. The first one is in position $$$a$$$, the second in position $$$b$$$. Positions are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right.Since they are rivals, you want to maximize the distance between them. If students are in positions $$$p$$$ and $$$s$$$ respectively, then distance between them is $$$|p - s|$$$. You can do the following operation at most $$$x$$$ times: choose two adjacent (neighbouring) students and swap them.Calculate the maximum distance between two rivalling students after at most $$$x$$$ swaps.",
