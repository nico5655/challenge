    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteNote to the first example. If you delete the $$$4$$$-th element, you can get the arithmetic progression $$$[2, 4, 6, 8]$$$.Note to the second example. The original sequence is already arithmetic progression, so you can delete $$$1$$$-st or last element and you will get an arithmetical progression again.",
    "prob_desc_description": "A sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k$$$ is called an arithmetic progression if for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ elements satisfy the condition $$$a_i = a_1 + c \\cdot (i - 1)$$$ for some fixed $$$c$$$.For example, these five sequences are arithmetic progressions: $$$[5, 7, 9, 11]$$$, $$$[101]$$$, $$$[101, 100, 99]$$$, $$$[13, 97]$$$ and $$$[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]$$$. And these four sequences aren't arithmetic progressions: $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 4, 8]$$$, $$$[1, -1, 1, -1]$$$ and $$$[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]$$$.You are given a sequence of integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$. Find any index $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le j \\le n$$$), such that if you delete $$$b_j$$$ from the sequence, you can reorder the remaining $$$n-1$$$ elements, so that you will get an arithmetic progression. If there is no such index, output the number -1.",

If there are multiple solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. If there is no such index, print -1.",
    "prob_desc_input_spec": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — length of the sequence $$$b$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the sequence $$$b$$$.",
