The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:  The pieces are arranged into a grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns.  For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece. Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.",
