Pick $$$i = 2, j= 4$$$ and add $$$\\gcd(a_2, a_4) = \\gcd(20, 25) = 5$$$ to the array.  Pick $$$i = 2, j= 5$$$ and add $$$\\gcd(a_2, a_5) = \\gcd(20, 30) = 10$$$ to the array. It can be proved that there is no way to perform more than $$$3$$$ operations on the original array.In the second example one can add $$$3$$$, then $$$1$$$, then $$$5$$$, and $$$2$$$.",

Here $$$\\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.
