New app suggested n available Beru-taxi nearby. The i-th taxi is located at point (xi, yi) and moves with a speed vi.

You answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6.  Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if .",

The i-th of the following n lines contains three integers xi, yi and vi ( - 100 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 100, 1 ≤ vi ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the i-th car and its speed.
