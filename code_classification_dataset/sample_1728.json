Teacher gave him a homework which Filya was unable to complete without your help.Filya is given an array of non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an. First, he pick an integer x and then he adds x to some elements of the array (no more than once), subtract x from some other elements (also, no more than once) and do no change other elements. He wants all elements of the array to be equal.Now he wonders if it's possible to pick such integer x and change some elements of the array using this x in order to make all elements equal.",
