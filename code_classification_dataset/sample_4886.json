Thus, the array remains unchanged and the answer is $$$a_1 = 10$$$.In the second set of input data, the array will always consist only of zeros.In the third set, the array will be changing as follows: $$$[\\color{blue}{-1}, 2, 0] \\to [3, \\color{blue}{1}] \\to [\\color{blue}{2}]$$$. The minimum elements are highlighted with $$$\\color{blue}{\\text{blue}}$$$. The maximal one is $$$2$$$.In the fourth set, the array will be modified as $$$[2, 10, \\color{blue}{1}, 7] \\to [\\color{blue}{1}, 9, 6] \\to [8, \\color{blue}{5}] \\to [\\color{blue}{3}]$$$. Similarly, the maximum of the minimum elements is $$$5$$$.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Yelisey has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.If $$$a$$$ has length strictly greater than $$$1$$$, then Yelisei can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it:   First, Yelisei finds the minimal number $$$m$$$ in the array. If there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them.  Then the selected minimal element is removed from the array. After that, $$$m$$$ is subtracted from each remaining element. Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by $$$1$$$.For example, if $$$a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4]$$$, then the minimum element in it is $$$a_3 = -4$$$, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to $$$a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]$$$.Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array $$$a$$$ to be as big as possible.Formally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array $$$a$$$ to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length $$$1$$$.Help him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero) minimum extraction operations to the array.",

The second line of the description lists $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
