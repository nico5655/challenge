    "prob_desc_description": "Despite his bad reputation, Captain Flint is a friendly person (at least, friendly to animals). Now Captain Flint is searching worthy sailors to join his new crew (solely for peaceful purposes). A sailor is considered as worthy if he can solve Flint's task.Recently, out of blue Captain Flint has been interested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a positive integer $$$x$$$ as nearly prime if it can be represented as $$$p \\cdot q$$$, where $$$1 &lt; p &lt; q$$$ and $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are prime numbers. For example, integers $$$6$$$ and $$$10$$$ are nearly primes (since $$$2 \\cdot 3 = 6$$$ and $$$2 \\cdot 5 = 10$$$), but integers $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$16$$$, $$$17$$$ or $$$44$$$ are not.Captain Flint guessed an integer $$$n$$$ and asked you: can you represent it as the sum of $$$4$$$ different positive integers where at least $$$3$$$ of them should be nearly prime.Uncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew. Can you do the same?",
