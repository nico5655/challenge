Such strings are called ternary strings.Your task is to replace minimum number of characters in this string with other characters to obtain a balanced ternary string (balanced ternary string is a ternary string such that the number of characters '0' in this string is equal to the number of characters '1', and the number of characters '1' (and '0' obviously) is equal to the number of characters '2').Among all possible balanced ternary strings you have to obtain the lexicographically (alphabetically) smallest.Note that you can neither remove characters from the string nor add characters to the string. Also note that you can replace the given characters only with characters '0', '1' and '2'.It is guaranteed that the answer exists.",
