So all friends can't present him different coins.",

He will be celebrating his birthday soon, so all his $$$M$$$ freinds decided to gift him coins. They all agreed to three terms:  Everyone must gift as many coins as others. All coins given to Ivan must be different. Not less than $$$L$$$ coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.But his friends don't know which coins have Ivan already got in his collection. They don't want to spend money so they want to buy minimum quantity of coins, that satisfy all terms, irrespective of the Ivan's collection. Help them to find this minimum number of coins or define it's not possible to meet all the terms.",
