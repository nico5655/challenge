    "prob_desc_description": "A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is a sequence of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing each number exactly once. For example, $$$[1]$$$, $$$[4, 3, 5, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$ are permutations, and $$$[1, 1]$$$, $$$[0, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 2, 1, 4]$$$ are not.There was a permutation $$$p[1 \\dots n]$$$. It was merged with itself. In other words, let's take two instances of $$$p$$$ and insert elements of the second $$$p$$$ into the first maintaining relative order of elements. The result is a sequence of the length $$$2n$$$.For example, if $$$p=[3, 1, 2]$$$ some possible results are: $$$[3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2]$$$. The following sequences are not possible results of a merging: $$$[1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3$$$], [$$$3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1]$$$.For example, if $$$p=[2, 1]$$$ the possible results are: $$$[2, 2, 1, 1]$$$, $$$[2, 1, 2, 1]$$$. The following sequences are not possible results of a merging: $$$[1, 1, 2, 2$$$], [$$$2, 1, 1, 2]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 2, 1]$$$.Your task is to restore the permutation $$$p$$$ by the given resulting sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
    "prob_desc_output_spec": "For each test case, print the answer: $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le p_i \\le n$$$), representing the initial permutation. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.",
    "prob_desc_input_spec": "The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 400$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) — the length of permutation. The second line of the test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the array $$$a$$$ represents the result of merging of some permutation $$$p$$$ with the same permutation $$$p$$$.",
