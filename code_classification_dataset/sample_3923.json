Gregor wants to find two bases of $$$P$$$. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ which satisfy both of the following properties.  $$$P \\bmod a = P \\bmod b$$$, where $$$x \\bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder when $$$x$$$ is divided by $$$y$$$, and  $$$2 \\le a &lt; b \\le P$$$. Help Gregor find two bases of his favorite prime number!",
