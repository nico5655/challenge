Initially, each element is equal to $$$0$$$ and there is a pointer located on the first element.We can do the following two kinds of operations any number of times (possibly zero) in any order: If the pointer is not on the last element, increase the element the pointer is currently on by $$$1$$$. Then move it to the next element. If the pointer is not on the first element, decrease the element the pointer is currently on by $$$1$$$. Then move it to the previous element.But there is one additional rule. After we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element.You are given an array $$$a$$$.
