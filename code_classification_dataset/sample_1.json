    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case of the example, the optimal sequence of moves can be as follows:  before making moves $$$a=[40, 6, 40, 3, 20, 1]$$$;  choose $$$c=6$$$;  now $$$a=[40, 3, 40, 3, 20, 1]$$$;  choose $$$c=40$$$;  now $$$a=[20, 3, 20, 3, 20, 1]$$$;  choose $$$c=20$$$;  now $$$a=[10, 3, 10, 3, 10, 1]$$$;  choose $$$c=10$$$;  now $$$a=[5, 3, 5, 3, 5, 1]$$$ — all numbers are odd. Thus, all numbers became odd after $$$4$$$ moves. In $$$3$$$ or fewer moves, you cannot make them all odd.",
    "prob_desc_description": "There are $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. For the one move you can choose any even value $$$c$$$ and divide by two all elements that equal $$$c$$$.For example, if $$$a=[6,8,12,6,3,12]$$$ and you choose $$$c=6$$$, and $$$a$$$ is transformed into $$$a=[3,8,12,3,3,12]$$$ after the move.You need to find the minimal number of moves for transforming $$$a$$$ to an array of only odd integers (each element shouldn't be divisible by $$$2$$$).",

The second line contains positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$). The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases in the input doesn't exceed $$$2\\cdot10^5$$$.",
