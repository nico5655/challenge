    "prob_desc_description": "You are given a matrix of size $$$n \\times n$$$ filled with lowercase English letters. You can change no more than $$$k$$$ letters in this matrix.Consider all paths from the upper left corner to the lower right corner that move from a cell to its neighboring cell to the right or down. Each path is associated with the string that is formed by all the letters in the cells the path visits. Thus, the length of each string is $$$2n - 1$$$.Find the lexicographically smallest string that can be associated with a path after changing letters in at most $$$k$$$ cells of the matrix.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$, if the first different letter in $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is smaller in $$$a$$$.",
