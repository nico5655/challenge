    "prob_desc_description": "Bash has set out on a journey to become the greatest Pokemon master. To get his first Pokemon, he went to Professor Zulu's Lab. Since Bash is Professor Zulu's favourite student, Zulu allows him to take as many Pokemon from his lab as he pleases.But Zulu warns him that a group of k &gt; 1 Pokemon with strengths {s1, s2, s3, ..., sk} tend to fight among each other if gcd(s1, s2, s3, ..., sk) = 1 (see notes for gcd definition).Bash, being smart, does not want his Pokemon to fight among each other. However, he also wants to maximize the number of Pokemon he takes from the lab. Can you help Bash find out the maximum number of Pokemon he can take? Note: A Pokemon cannot fight with itself.",
