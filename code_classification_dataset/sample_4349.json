    "prob_desc_description": "Mocha is a young girl from high school. She has learned so much interesting knowledge from her teachers, especially her math teacher. Recently, Mocha is learning about binary system and very interested in bitwise operation.This day, Mocha got a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In each operation, she can select an arbitrary interval $$$[l, r]$$$ and for all values $$$i$$$ ($$$0\\leq i \\leq r-l$$$), replace $$$a_{l+i}$$$ with $$$a_{l+i} \\,\\&amp;\\, a_{r-i}$$$ at the same time, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. This operation can be performed any number of times.For example, if $$$n=5$$$, the array is $$$[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5]$$$, and Mocha selects the interval $$$[2,5]$$$, then the new array is $$$[a_1,a_2\\,\\&amp;\\, a_5, a_3\\,\\&amp;\\, a_4, a_4\\,\\&amp;\\, a_3, a_5\\,\\&amp;\\, a_2]$$$.Now Mocha wants to minimize the maximum value in the sequence. As her best friend, can you help her to get the answer?",

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).",
