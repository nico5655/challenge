It is known that if the current score is «$$$x$$$:$$$y$$$», then after the goal it will change to \"$$$x+1$$$:$$$y$$$\" or \"$$$x$$$:$$$y+1$$$\". What is the largest number of times a draw could appear on the scoreboard?The pairs \"$$$a_i$$$:$$$b_i$$$\" are given in chronological order (time increases), but you are given score only for some moments of time. The last pair corresponds to the end of the match.",

All moments are given in chronological order, that is, sequences $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_j$$$ are non-decreasing. The last score denotes the final result of the match.",
