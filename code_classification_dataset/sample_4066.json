Each morning, Cirno can choose a house which is uninfected and protect the house from being infected permanently.Every day, the following things happen in order:  Cirno chooses an uninfected house, and protect it permanently.  All uninfected, unprotected houses which have at least one infected neighbor become infected. Cirno wants to stop the virus from spreading. Find the minimum number of houses that will be infected in the end, if she optimally choose the houses to protect.Note that every day Cirno always chooses a house to protect before the virus spreads. Also, a protected house will not be infected forever.",

The second line of each test case consists of $$$m$$$ distinct positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\cdots , a_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$$$) — the indices of the houses infected initially.
