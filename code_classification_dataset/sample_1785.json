Kefa has n friends, each friend will agree to go to the restaurant if Kefa asks. Each friend is characterized by the amount of money he has and the friendship factor in respect to Kefa. The parrot doesn't want any friend to feel poor compared to somebody else in the company (Kefa doesn't count). A friend feels poor if in the company there is someone who has at least d units of money more than he does. Also, Kefa wants the total friendship factor of the members of the company to be maximum.
