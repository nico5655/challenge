In total, he will spend $$$4$$$ days and will fit in the limit.In the third test case, it's impossible to fit in the limit. For example, if Adilbek will optimize the program $$$2$$$ days, it'll still work $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{11}{2+1} \\right\\rceil = 4$$$ days.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Adilbek was assigned to a special project. For Adilbek it means that he has $$$n$$$ days to run a special program and provide its results. But there is a problem: the program needs to run for $$$d$$$ days to calculate the results.Fortunately, Adilbek can optimize the program. If he spends $$$x$$$ ($$$x$$$ is a non-negative integer) days optimizing the program, he will make the program run in $$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{d}{x + 1} \\right\\rceil$$$ days ($$$\\left\\lceil a \\right\\rceil$$$ is the ceiling function: $$$\\left\\lceil 2.4 \\right\\rceil = 3$$$, $$$\\left\\lceil 2 \\right\\rceil = 2$$$). The program cannot be run and optimized simultaneously, so the total number of days he will spend is equal to $$$x + \\left\\lceil \\frac{d}{x + 1} \\right\\rceil$$$.Will Adilbek be able to provide the generated results in no more than $$$n$$$ days?",
