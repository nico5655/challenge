    "prob_desc_description": "You have a permutation: an array $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$$$ of distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The length of the permutation $$$n$$$ is odd.Consider the following algorithm of sorting the permutation in increasing order.A helper procedure of the algorithm, $$$f(i)$$$, takes a single argument $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le n-1$$$) and does the following. If $$$a_i &gt; a_{i+1}$$$, the values of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ are exchanged. Otherwise, the permutation doesn't change.The algorithm consists of iterations, numbered with consecutive integers starting with $$$1$$$. On the $$$i$$$-th iteration, the algorithm does the following:   if $$$i$$$ is odd, call $$$f(1), f(3), \\ldots, f(n - 2)$$$;  if $$$i$$$ is even, call $$$f(2), f(4), \\ldots, f(n - 1)$$$. It can be proven that after a finite number of iterations the permutation will be sorted in increasing order.After how many iterations will this happen for the first time?",

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 999$$$; $$$n$$$ is odd) — the length of the permutation. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le n$$$) — the permutation itself.  It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$999$$$.",
