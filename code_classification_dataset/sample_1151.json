When he is in the second cell he needs to jump two cells left so he will jump out of the strip.Second sample grasshopper path is 1 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 and so on. The path is infinite.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Little Artem found a grasshopper. He brought it to his house and constructed a jumping area for him.The area looks like a strip of cells 1 × n. Each cell contains the direction for the next jump and the length of that jump. Grasshopper starts in the first cell and follows the instructions written on the cells. Grasshopper stops immediately if it jumps out of the strip. Now Artem wants to find out if this will ever happen.",

Next line contains n integers di (1 ≤ di ≤ 109) — the length of the jump from the i-th cell.",
