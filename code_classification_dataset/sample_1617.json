Between each two adjacent floors in the building, there is a staircase connecting them.It's lunchtime for our sensei Colin \"ConneR\" Neumann Jr, and he's planning for a location to enjoy his meal.ConneR's office is at floor $$$s$$$ of the building. On each floor (including floor $$$s$$$, of course), there is a restaurant offering meals. However, due to renovations being in progress, $$$k$$$ of the restaurants are currently closed, and as a result, ConneR can't enjoy his lunch there.CooneR wants to reach a restaurant as quickly as possible to save time. What is the minimum number of staircases he needs to walk to reach a closest currently open restaurant.Please answer him quickly, and you might earn his praise and even enjoy the lunch with him in the elegant Neumanns' way!",
