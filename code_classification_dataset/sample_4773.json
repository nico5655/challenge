    "prob_desc_description": "This is the easy version of Problem F. The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints.We will call a non-empty string balanced if it contains the same number of plus and minus signs. For example: strings \"+--+\" and \"++-+--\" are balanced, and strings \"+--\", \"--\" and \"\" are not balanced.We will call a string promising if the string can be made balanced by several (possibly zero) uses of the following operation:  replace two adjacent minus signs with one plus sign. In particular, every balanced string is promising. However, the converse is not true: not every promising string is balanced.For example, the string \"-+---\" is promising, because you can replace two adjacent minuses with plus and get a balanced string \"-++-\", or get another balanced string \"-+-+\".How many non-empty substrings of the given string $$$s$$$ are promising? Each non-empty promising substring must be counted in the answer as many times as it occurs in string $$$s$$$.Recall that a substring is a sequence of consecutive characters of the string. For example, for string \"+-+\" its substring are: \"+-\", \"-+\", \"+\", \"+-+\" (the string is a substring of itself) and some others. But the following strings are not its substring: \"--\", \"++\", \"-++\".",

The second line of the test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of characters \"+\" and \"-\". It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3000$$$.",
