Regardless of the initial order, numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ are adjacent, so it's needed to place their least common multiple between them. After that the circle becomes $$$2, 6, 3, 6$$$, and every two adjacent numbers are not coprime.In the second test case $$$4$$$ has two divisors greater than $$$1$$$: $$$2, 4$$$, and they are not coprime, so any initial order is correct, and it's not needed to place any least common multiples.In the third test case all divisors of $$$30$$$ greater than $$$1$$$ can be placed in some order so that there are no two adjacent numbers that are coprime.",
    "prob_desc_description": "An agent called Cypher is decrypting a message, that contains a composite number $$$n$$$. All divisors of $$$n$$$, which are greater than $$$1$$$, are placed in a circle. Cypher can choose the initial order of numbers in the circle.In one move Cypher can choose two adjacent numbers in a circle and insert their least common multiple between them. He can do that move as many times as needed.A message is decrypted, if every two adjacent numbers are not coprime. Note that for such constraints it's always possible to decrypt the message.Find the minimal number of moves that Cypher should do to decrypt the message, and show the initial order of numbers in the circle for that.",
