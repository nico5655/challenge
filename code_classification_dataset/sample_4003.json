Thus, the following is a solution sequence that gives a minimum travel distance: $$$0 \\to 2 \\to 0 \\to 4 \\to 0 \\to 3 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 5$$$, where each $$$0$$$ means you go the origin and grab one bag, and each positive integer means you deliver the bag to a depot at this coordinate, giving a total distance of $$$25$$$ units. It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.In the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: $$$0 \\to 6 \\to 8 \\to 7 \\to 0 \\to 5 \\to 4 \\to 3 \\to 0 \\to (-5) \\to (-10) \\to (-15)$$$, with distance $$$41$$$. It can be shown that $$$41$$$ is the optimal distance for this test case.",

You must collect the required number of goods from the origin, deliver them to the respective depots, and then return to the origin to collect your next batch of goods.Calculate the minimum distance you need to cover to deliver all the bags of goods to the depots.
