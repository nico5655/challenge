Can you put all dominoes in a line one by one from left to right so that any two dominoes touched with the sides that had the same number of points? You can rotate the dominoes, changing the left and the right side (domino \"1-4\" turns into \"4-1\").",

You put the dominoes from left to right. In each of n lines print the index of the domino to put in the corresponding position and then, after a space, character \"+\" (if you don't need to turn the domino) or \"–\" (if you need to turn it).",
