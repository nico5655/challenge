Formally if $$$p_i$$$ is the bitwise XOR of all elements in $$$a$$$ which are strictly less than $$$a_i$$$, then $$$a$$$ is an interesting sequence if $$$p_1 = p_2 = \\ldots = p_n = 0$$$.For example, sequences $$$[1,3,2,3,1,2,3]$$$, $$$[4,4,4,4]$$$, $$$[25]$$$ are interesting, whereas $$$[1,2,3,4]$$$ ($$$p_2 = 1 \\ne 0$$$), $$$[4,1,1,2,4]$$$ ($$$p_1 = 1 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 2 = 2 \\ne 0$$$), $$$[29,30,30]$$$ ($$$p_2 = 29 \\ne 0$$$) aren't interesting.Here $$$a \\oplus b$$$ denotes bitwise XOR of integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Find any interesting sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ (or report that there exists no such sequence) such that the sum of the elements in the sequence $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$m$$$, i.e. $$$a_1 + a_2 \\ldots + a_n = m$$$.As a reminder, the bitwise XOR of an empty sequence is considered to be $$$0$$$.",
