Then $$$x = 2 \\oplus 5 \\oplus 4 = 3$$$ ($$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR), so the new array is $$$[2, 5, 4, 3]$$$. Afterwards, the array is shuffled to form $$$[4, 3, 2, 5]$$$.In the second test case, one possible array $$$a$$$ is $$$a=[1, 10, 6, 10]$$$. Then $$$x = 1 \\oplus 10 \\oplus 6 \\oplus 10 = 7$$$, so the new array is $$$[1, 10, 6, 10, 7]$$$. Afterwards, the array is shuffled to form $$$[6, 1, 10, 7, 10]$$$.In the third test case, all elements of the array are equal to $$$6$$$, so $$$x=6$$$.In the fourth test case, one possible array $$$a$$$ is $$$a=[100, 100]$$$. Then $$$x = 100 \\oplus 100 = 0$$$, so the new array is $$$[100, 100, 0]$$$. Afterwards, the array is shuffled to form $$$[100, 100, 0]$$$.

The number $$$x$$$ is added to the end of the array $$$a$$$ (now it has length $$$n$$$), and then the elements are shuffled.You are given the newly formed array $$$a$$$. What is $$$x$$$?

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 127$$$) — the elements of the newly formed array $$$a$$$.
