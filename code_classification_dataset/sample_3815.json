There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is $$$2$$$ because they eat two candies in total.For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight $$$7$$$) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight $$$7$$$). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is $$$6$$$ (because they eat six candies in total).For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is $$$0$$$.For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights $$$[7, 3, 20]$$$ and Bob will eat candies with weights $$$[10, 8, 11, 1]$$$, they each eat $$$30$$$ weight. There is no better partition so the answer is $$$7$$$.",

Alice and Bob eat candies. Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).They want to be fair.
