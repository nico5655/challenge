    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case, one of the ways to make $$$s$$$ good is the following.Change $$$s_3$$$, $$$s_6$$$ and $$$s_7$$$ to '0', after that $$$s$$$ becomes \"1100000000\", it can be divided into \"11\" and \"00000000\", which lengths are $$$2$$$ and $$$8$$$ respectively, the number of subsegments of it is $$$2$$$. There are other ways to operate $$$3$$$ times to make $$$s$$$ good, such as \"1111110000\", \"1100001100\", \"1111001100\", the number of subsegments of them are $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$4$$$ respectively. It's easy to find that the minimum number of subsegments among all solutions with the minimum number of operations is $$$2$$$.In the second, third and fourth test cases, $$$s$$$ is good initially, so no operation is required.",
    "prob_desc_description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments.Tokitsukaze has a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of zeros and ones, $$$n$$$ is even.Now Tokitsukaze divides $$$s$$$ into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same. After that, $$$s$$$ is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.For example, if $$$s$$$ is \"11001111\", it will be divided into \"11\", \"00\" and \"1111\". Their lengths are $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ respectively, which are all even numbers, so \"11001111\" is good. Another example, if $$$s$$$ is \"1110011000\", it will be divided into \"111\", \"00\", \"11\" and \"000\", and their lengths are $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$. Obviously, \"1110011000\" is not good.Tokitsukaze wants to make $$$s$$$ good by changing the values of some positions in $$$s$$$. Specifically, she can perform the operation any number of times: change the value of $$$s_i$$$ to '0' or '1' ($$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$). Can you tell her the minimum number of operations to make $$$s$$$ good? Meanwhile, she also wants to know the minimum number of subsegments that $$$s$$$ can be divided into among all solutions with the minimum number of operations.",

For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$, it is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is even. The second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of zeros and ones. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
