The red stripe was painted after the blue one, so the answer is R. ",

Each of these characters is either 'R', 'B', or '.', denoting a red square, a blue square, and an unpainted square, respectively. It is guaranteed that the given field is obtained from a colorless one by drawing horizontal red rows and vertical blue columns. At least one stripe is painted.",
