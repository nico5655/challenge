They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal.However I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!",
