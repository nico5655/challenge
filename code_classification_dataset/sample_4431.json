Since 'a' occurs strictly more times than 'b' and 'c', the substring \"aa\" satisfies the condition and the answer is $$$2$$$. The substring \"a\" also satisfies this condition, however its length is not at least $$$2$$$.In the second test case, it can be shown that in none of the substrings of \"cbabb\" does 'a' occur strictly more times than 'b' and 'c' each.In the third test case, \"cacabccc\", the length of the smallest substring that satisfies the conditions is $$$3$$$.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Ashish has a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ containing only characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.He wants to find the length of the smallest substring, which satisfies the following conditions:   Length of the substring is at least $$$2$$$  'a' occurs strictly more times in this substring than 'b'  'a' occurs strictly more times in this substring than 'c'  Ashish is busy planning his next Codeforces round. Help him solve the problem.A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.",

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.
