Here is an invalid pairing for the same graph  — the subgraph $$$\\{1,3,4,5\\}$$$ has $$$3$$$ edges.   Here is the pairing outputted in the third case.

    "prob_desc_description": "You have a simple and connected undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges.Consider any way to pair some subset of these $$$n$$$ nodes such that no node is present in more than one pair. This pairing is valid if for every pair of pairs, the induced subgraph containing all $$$4$$$ nodes, two from each pair, has at most $$$2$$$ edges (out of the $$$6$$$ possible edges). More formally, for any two pairs, $$$(a,b)$$$ and $$$(c,d)$$$, the induced subgraph with nodes $$$\\{a,b,c,d\\}$$$ should have at most $$$2$$$ edges. Please note that the subgraph induced by a set of nodes contains nodes only from this set and edges which have both of its end points in this set.Now, do one of the following:   Find a simple path consisting of at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$$$ nodes. Here, a path is called simple if it does not visit any node multiple times.  Find a valid pairing in which at least $$$\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$$$ nodes are paired. It can be shown that it is possible to find at least one of the two in every graph satisfying constraints from the statement. ",
    "prob_desc_output_spec": "For each test case, the output format is as follows.  If you have found a pairing, in the first line output \"PAIRING\" (without quotes).    Then, output $$$k$$$ ($$$\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil \\le 2\\cdot k \\le n$$$), the number of pairs in your pairing.  Then, in each of the next $$$k$$$ lines, output $$$2$$$ integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$  — denoting that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are paired with each other. Note that the graph does not have to have an edge between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$! This pairing has to be valid, and every node has to be a part of at most $$$1$$$ pair.  Otherwise, in the first line output \"PATH\" (without quotes).   Then, output $$$k$$$ ($$$\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil \\le k \\le n$$$), the number of nodes in your path.  Then, in the second line, output $$$k$$$ integers, $$$v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k$$$, in the order in which they appear on the path. Formally, $$$v_i$$$ and $$$v_{i+1}$$$ should have an edge between them for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i &lt; k$$$). This path has to be simple, meaning no node should appear more than once. ",

The next $$$m$$$ lines each contain $$$2$$$ integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$), denoting that there is an undirected edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in the given graph. It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected, and simple  — it does not contain multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, nor does it have any self-loops.  It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\\cdot 10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.",
