In the second test case, it can be shown there is no way to order people in a way that satisfies the condition.In the third test case, the only way to arrange people to satisfy the condition is to have the first person on the back row and the second person on the front row.",

However, to ensure that everyone is seen properly, the $$$j$$$-th person of the back row must be at least $$$x$$$ units taller than the $$$j$$$-th person of the front row for each $$$j$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive.Help Mark determine if this is possible.",
