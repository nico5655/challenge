This is an AP with a difference $$$d=10$$$.In the second test case the resulting sequence will be $$$[30, 20, 10]$$$. This is an AP with a difference $$$d=-10$$$.In the third test case, you can choose $$$m=1$$$ and multiply any number by $$$1$$$. The resulting sequence will be $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$. This is an AP with a difference $$$d=1$$$.In the fourth test case, you can choose $$$m=9$$$ and multiply the first number ($$$a=1$$$) by $$$9$$$. The resulting sequence will be $$$[9, 6, 3]$$$. This is an AP with a difference $$$d=-3$$$.In the fifth test case, it is impossible to make an AP.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Polycarp has $$$3$$$ positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$. He can perform the following operation exactly once.  Choose a positive integer $$$m$$$ and multiply exactly one of the integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ or $$$c$$$ by $$$m$$$. Can Polycarp make it so that after performing the operation, the sequence of three numbers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ (in this order) forms an arithmetic progression? Note that you cannot change the order of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$.Formally, a sequence $$$x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$$$ is called an arithmetic progression (AP) if there exists a number $$$d$$$ (called \"common difference\") such that $$$x_{i+1}=x_i+d$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. In this problem, $$$n=3$$$.For example, the following sequences are AP: $$$[5, 10, 15]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 1, 1]$$$, and $$$[13, 10, 7]$$$. The following sequences are not AP: $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[0, 1, 0]$$$ and $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.You need to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
