Now the sequence $$$a$$$ is $$$[1,1,3]$$$.In the $$$2$$$-nd operation, $$$a_1 = a_2 = 1$$$, after the operation, $$$a_1 = 0$$$. Now the sequence $$$a$$$ is $$$[0,1,3]$$$.In the $$$3$$$-rd operation, $$$a_1 &lt; a_2$$$, after the operation, $$$a_2 = 0$$$. Now the sequence $$$a$$$ is $$$[0,0,3]$$$.In the $$$4$$$-th operation, $$$a_2 &lt; a_3$$$, after the operation, $$$a_3 = 0$$$. Now the sequence $$$a$$$ is $$$[0,0,0]$$$.So the minimum number of operations is $$$4$$$.",

If $$$a_i = a_j$$$, change one of them to $$$0$$$.  Otherwise change both of them to $$$\\min(a_i, a_j)$$$.
