    "prob_desc_description": "People in the Tomskaya region like magic formulas very much. You can see some of them below.Imagine you are given a sequence of positive integer numbers p1, p2, ..., pn. Lets write down some magic formulas:Here, \"mod\" means the operation of taking the residue after dividing.The expression  means applying the bitwise xor (excluding \"OR\") operation to integers x and y. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages. For example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented by \"^\", in Pascal — by \"xor\".People in the Tomskaya region like magic formulas very much, but they don't like to calculate them! Therefore you are given the sequence p, calculate the value of Q.",
