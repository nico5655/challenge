The neighboring houses are $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, ..., $$$n-1$$$ and $$$n$$$. The houses $$$n$$$ and $$$1$$$ are not neighboring.The houses are colored in colors $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$ so that the $$$i$$$-th house is colored in the color $$$c_i$$$. Everyone knows that Chordalsk is not boring, so there are at least two houses colored in different colors.Ilya wants to select two houses $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ so that $$$1 \\leq i &lt; j \\leq n$$$, and they have different colors: $$$c_i \\neq c_j$$$. He will then walk from the house $$$i$$$ to the house $$$j$$$ the distance of $$$(j-i)$$$ units.Ilya loves long walks, so he wants to choose the houses so that the distance between them is the maximum possible.Help Ilya, find this maximum possible distance.",
