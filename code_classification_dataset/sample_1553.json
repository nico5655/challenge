The following $$$m$$$ lines denote edges: edge $$$i$$$ is represented by a pair of integers $$$v_i$$$, $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\ne v_i$$$), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair ($$$v_i, u_i$$$) there are no other pairs ($$$v_i, u_i$$$) or ($$$u_i, v_i$$$) in the list of edges, and for each pair ($$$v_i, u_i$$$) the condition $$$v_i \\ne u_i$$$ is satisfied.
