Instead of money, the waiter wants Iahub to write a Hungry sequence consisting of n integers. A sequence a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n integers, is Hungry if and only if:   Its elements are in increasing order. That is an inequality ai &lt; aj holds for any two indices i, j (i &lt; j).  For any two indices i and j (i &lt; j), aj must not be divisible by ai. Iahub is in trouble, so he asks you for help. Find a Hungry sequence with n elements.",
