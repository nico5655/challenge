After that you can erase it whole. You could erase the whole string from the beginning but you would get one move instead of two.In the third example you can first erase the brackets on positions $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$: \"([)]\". They form an RBS \"()\". Then \"[]\" is left, so you can erase it whole.In the fourth example there is no subsequence that is an RBS, so you can't perform a move at all.In the fifth example you can erase the brackets on positions $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$: \")[(]\" and get \")(\" as a result. You can erase nothing from it.",
