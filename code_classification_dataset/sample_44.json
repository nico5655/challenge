He especially likes stairs.Sequence a1, a2, ..., a|a| (|a| is the length of the sequence) is stairs if there is such index i (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|), that the following condition is met: a1 &lt; a2 &lt; ... &lt; ai - 1 &lt; ai &gt; ai + 1 &gt; ... &gt; a|a| - 1 &gt; a|a|.For example, sequences [1, 2, 3, 2] and [4, 2] are stairs and sequence [3, 1, 2] isn't.Sereja has m cards with numbers. He wants to put some cards on the table in a row to get a stair sequence. What maximum number of cards can he put on the table?",
