    "prob_desc_description": "The only difference between easy and hard versions is the size of the input.You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters, each character is 'R', 'G' or 'B'.You are also given an integer $$$k$$$. Your task is to change the minimum number of characters in the initial string $$$s$$$ so that after the changes there will be a string of length $$$k$$$ that is a substring of $$$s$$$, and is also a substring of the infinite string \"RGBRGBRGB ...\".A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of string $$$b$$$ if there exists a positive integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_1 = b_i$$$, $$$a_2 = b_{i + 1}$$$, $$$a_3 = b_{i + 2}$$$, ..., $$$a_{|a|} = b_{i + |a| - 1}$$$. For example, strings \"GBRG\", \"B\", \"BR\" are substrings of the infinite string \"RGBRGBRGB ...\" while \"GR\", \"RGR\" and \"GGG\" are not.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.",
