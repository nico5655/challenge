If we add $$$1$$$ to the first element, the array will be $$$[3,-1,-1]$$$, the sum will be equal to $$$1$$$ and the product will be equal to $$$3$$$.In the second test case, both product and sum are $$$0$$$. If we add $$$1$$$ to the second and the third element, the array will be $$$[-1,1,1,1]$$$, the sum will be equal to $$$2$$$ and the product will be equal to $$$-1$$$. It can be shown that fewer steps can't be enough.In the third test case, both sum and product are non-zero, we don't need to do anything.In the fourth test case, after adding $$$1$$$ twice to the first element the array will be $$$[2,-2,1]$$$, the sum will be $$$1$$$ and the product will be $$$-4$$$.",

Formally, find the minimum number of steps to make $$$a_1 + a_2 +$$$ $$$\\dots$$$ $$$+ a_n \\ne 0$$$ and $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot$$$ $$$\\dots$$$ $$$\\cdot a_n \\ne 0$$$.",
