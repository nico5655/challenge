The string becomes \"VKKV\". Swap first two letters. The string becomes \"KVKV\". Swap the second and the third letter. The string becomes \"KKVV\". Indeed, this string doesn't have a substring \"VK\".In the second sample, there are two optimal sequences of moves. One is \"BVVKV\"  →  \"VBVKV\"  →  \"VVBKV\". The other is \"BVVKV\"  →  \"BVKVV\"  →  \"BKVVV\".In the fifth sample, no swaps are necessary.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Bear Limak prepares problems for a programming competition. Of course, it would be unprofessional to mention the sponsor name in the statement. Limak takes it seriously and he is going to change some words. To make it still possible to read, he will try to modify each word as little as possible.Limak has a string s that consists of uppercase English letters. In one move he can swap two adjacent letters of the string. For example, he can transform a string \"ABBC\" into \"BABC\" or \"ABCB\" in one move.Limak wants to obtain a string without a substring \"VK\" (i.e. there should be no letter 'V' immediately followed by letter 'K'). It can be easily proved that it's possible for any initial string s.What is the minimum possible number of moves Limak can do?",
