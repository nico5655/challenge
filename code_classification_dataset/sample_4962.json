    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case, we have $$$s=0$$$ so all numbers are equal to $$$0$$$ and there isn't any number equal to $$$49$$$.In the second test case, we have $$$s=1$$$. There are two possible sequences: $$$[0, 1]$$$ or $$$[1, 0]$$$. In both cases, the number $$$1$$$ appears just once. In the third test case, we have $$$s=12$$$, which is the maximum possible value of $$$s$$$ for this case. Thus, the number $$$4$$$ appears $$$3$$$ times in the sequence.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Luis has a sequence of $$$n+1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n+1}$$$. For each $$$i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n+1$$$ it is guaranteed that $$$0\\leq a_i &lt; n$$$, or $$$a_i=n^2$$$. He has calculated the sum of all the elements of the sequence, and called this value $$$s$$$. Luis has lost his sequence, but he remembers the values of $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$. Can you find the number of elements in the sequence that are equal to $$$n^2$$$?We can show that the answer is unique under the given constraints.",

It is guaranteed that the value of $$$s$$$ is a valid sum for some sequence satisfying the above constraints.",
