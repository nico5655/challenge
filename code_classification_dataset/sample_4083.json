The robot can't move outside the grid.The cell $$$(s_x, s_y)$$$ contains a deadly laser. If the robot comes into some cell that has distance less than or equal to $$$d$$$ to the laser, it gets evaporated. The distance between two cells $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is $$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$$.Print the smallest number of steps that the robot can take to reach the cell $$$(n, m)$$$ without getting evaporated or moving outside the grid. If it's not possible to reach the cell $$$(n, m)$$$, print -1.The laser is neither in the starting cell, nor in the ending cell.
