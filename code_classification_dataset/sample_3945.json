That is, the values of the elements don't matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, any array of length $$$3$$$ has exactly $$$7$$$ different non-empty subsequences.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Polycarp had an array $$$a$$$ of $$$3$$$ positive integers. He wrote out the sums of all non-empty subsequences of this array, sorted them in non-decreasing order, and got an array $$$b$$$ of $$$7$$$ integers.For example, if $$$a = \\{1, 4, 3\\}$$$, then Polycarp wrote out $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$1 + 4 = 5$$$, $$$1 + 3 = 4$$$, $$$4 + 3 = 7$$$, $$$1 + 4 + 3 = 8$$$. After sorting, he got an array $$$b = \\{1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8\\}.$$$Unfortunately, Polycarp lost the array $$$a$$$. He only has the array $$$b$$$ left. Help him to restore the array $$$a$$$.",
