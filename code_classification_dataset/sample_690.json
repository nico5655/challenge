    "prob_desc_description": "Nastya just made a huge mistake and dropped a whole package of rice on the floor. Mom will come soon. If she sees this, then Nastya will be punished.In total, Nastya dropped $$$n$$$ grains. Nastya read that each grain weighs some integer number of grams from $$$a - b$$$ to $$$a + b$$$, inclusive (numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are known), and the whole package of $$$n$$$ grains weighs from $$$c - d$$$ to $$$c + d$$$ grams, inclusive (numbers $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ are known). The weight of the package is the sum of the weights of all $$$n$$$ grains in it.Help Nastya understand if this information can be correct. In other words, check whether each grain can have such a mass that the $$$i$$$-th grain weighs some integer number $$$x_i$$$ $$$(a - b \\leq x_i \\leq a + b)$$$, and in total they weigh from $$$c - d$$$ to $$$c + d$$$, inclusive ($$$c - d \\leq \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_i} \\leq c + d$$$).",
    "prob_desc_output_spec": "For each test case given in the input print \"Yes\", if the information about the weights is not inconsistent, and print \"No\" if $$$n$$$ grains with masses from $$$a - b$$$ to $$$a + b$$$ cannot make a package with a total mass from $$$c - d$$$ to $$$c + d$$$.",
