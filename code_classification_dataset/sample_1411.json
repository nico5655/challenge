One can check that there is no choice of elements from the first and the second bag which sum to $$$2$$$ modulo $$$5$$$.In the second sample, the contents of the first bag are $$$\\{5,25,125,625\\}$$$, while the second bag contains all other nonnegative integers with at most $$$9$$$ decimal digits.

The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is $$$\\{0,1,â€¦,M-1\\}$$$, for some positive integer $$$M$$$.

The outputs should be sorted in increasing order of magnitude. If $$$K$$$=0, do not output the second line.",
