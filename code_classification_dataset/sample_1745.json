    "prob_desc_description": "  \"You must lift the dam. With a lever. I will give it to you.You must block the canal. With a rock. I will not give the rock to you.\" Danik urgently needs rock and lever! Obviously, the easiest way to get these things is to ask Hermit Lizard for them.Hermit Lizard agreed to give Danik the lever. But to get a stone, Danik needs to solve the following task.You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$, and an array $$$a$$$ of positive integers. The task is to calculate the number of such pairs $$$(i,j)$$$ that $$$i&lt;j$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ $$$\\&amp;$$$ $$$a_j \\ge a_i \\oplus a_j$$$, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation, and $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.Danik has solved this task. But can you solve it?",

The second line contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — elements of the array.
