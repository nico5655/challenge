    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case, there is no possible way to paint the sequence. For example, if you paint the sequence this way: $$$[\\myblue{1},\\myblue{2},\\myred{3}]$$$ (where $$$3$$$ is painted red, $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ are painted blue) then $$$\\text{Count}(\\RED)=1 &lt; \\text{Count}(\\BLUE)=2$$$, but $$$\\text{Sum}(\\RED)=3 \\ngtr \\text{Sum}(\\BLUE)=3$$$. So, this is not a possible way to paint the sequence.In the second test case, a possible way to paint the sequence is described in the statement. We can see that $$$\\text{Sum}(\\RED)=6 &gt; \\text{Sum}(\\BLUE)=5$$$ and $$$\\text{Count}(\\RED)=1 &lt; \\text{Count}(\\BLUE)=2$$$.In the third test case, there is no possible way to paint the sequence. For example, if you paint the sequence this way: $$$[\\myred{3},\\myred{5},\\myblue{4}, \\myblue{2}]$$$ (where $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ are painted red, $$$4$$$ and $$$2$$$ are painted blue) then $$$\\text{Sum}(\\RED) = 8 &gt; \\text{Sum}(\\BLUE) = 6$$$ but $$$\\text{Count}(\\RED) = 2 \\nless \\text{Count}(\\BLUE) = 2$$$. So, this is not a possible way to paint the sequence.In the fourth test case, it can be proven that there is no possible way to paint the sequence satisfying sum and count constraints.",
    "prob_desc_description": "$$$ \\def\\myred#1{\\color{red}{\\underline{\\bf{#1}}}} \\def\\myblue#1{\\color{blue}{\\overline{\\bf{#1}}}} $$$ $$$\\def\\RED{\\myred{Red}} \\def\\BLUE{\\myblue{Blue}}$$$You are given a sequence of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$. Initially, all the elements of the sequence are unpainted. You can paint each number $$$\\RED$$$ or $$$\\BLUE$$$ (but not both), or leave it unpainted. For a color $$$c$$$, $$$\\text{Count}(c)$$$ is the number of elements in the sequence painted with that color and $$$\\text{Sum}(c)$$$ is the sum of the elements in the sequence painted with that color.For example, if the given sequence is $$$[2, 8, 6, 3, 1]$$$ and it is painted this way: $$$[\\myblue{2}, 8, \\myred{6}, \\myblue{3}, 1]$$$ (where $$$6$$$ is painted red, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ are painted blue, $$$1$$$ and $$$8$$$ are unpainted) then $$$\\text{Sum}(\\RED)=6$$$, $$$\\text{Sum}(\\BLUE)=2+3=5$$$, $$$\\text{Count}(\\RED)=1$$$, and $$$\\text{Count}(\\BLUE)=2$$$.Determine if it is possible to paint the sequence so that $$$\\text{Sum}(\\RED) &gt; \\text{Sum}(\\BLUE)$$$ and $$$\\text{Count}(\\RED) &lt; \\text{Count}(\\BLUE)$$$.",

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i\\le 10^9$$$) — the given sequence. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
