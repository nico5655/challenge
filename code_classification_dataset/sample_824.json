Bob is asked to divide those numbers into groups, where each group must contain at least $$$2$$$ numbers. Suppose the numbers are divided into $$$m$$$ groups, and the sum of the numbers in the $$$j$$$-th group is $$$s_j$$$. Bob's aim is to minimize the sum of the square of $$$s_j$$$, that is $$$$$$\\sum_{j = 1}^{m} s_j^2.$$$$$$Bob is puzzled by this hard problem. Could you please help him solve it?",
