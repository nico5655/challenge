    "prob_desc_description": "Recently, the students of School 179 have developed a unique algorithm, which takes in a binary string $$$s$$$ as input. However, they soon found out that if some substring $$$t$$$ of $$$s$$$ is a palindrome of length greater than 1, the algorithm will work incorrectly. Can the students somehow reorder the characters of $$$s$$$ so that the algorithm will work correctly on the string?A binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1.A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.",
    "prob_desc_output_spec": "For each test case, print YES (case-insensitive) if it is possible to reorder the characters of $$$s$$$ so that there are no substrings that are a palindrome of length greater than 1, or NO (case-insensitive) otherwise.",
    "prob_desc_input_spec": "Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) â€” the length of the string $$$s$$$. The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of the characters 0 and 1.",
