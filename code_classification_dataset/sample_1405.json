    "prob_desc_description": "Squirrel Liss loves nuts. There are n trees (numbered 1 to n from west to east) along a street and there is a delicious nut on the top of each tree. The height of the tree i is hi. Liss wants to eat all nuts.Now Liss is on the root of the tree with the number 1. In one second Liss can perform one of the following actions:  Walk up or down one unit on a tree.  Eat a nut on the top of the current tree.  Jump to the next tree. In this action the height of Liss doesn't change. More formally, when Liss is at height h of the tree i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1), she jumps to height h of the tree i + 1. This action can't be performed if h &gt; hi + 1. Compute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat all nuts.",
