Regardless of Vova's turns the charge of the laptop battery is always decreases.Vova wants to complete the game (Vova can complete the game if after each of $$$n$$$ turns the charge of the laptop battery is strictly greater than $$$0$$$). Vova has to play exactly $$$n$$$ turns. Among all possible ways to complete the game, Vova wants to choose the one where the number of turns when he just plays (first type turn) is the maximum possible. It is possible that Vova cannot complete the game at all.Your task is to find out the maximum possible number of turns Vova can just play (make the first type turn) or report that Vova cannot complete the game.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.",
