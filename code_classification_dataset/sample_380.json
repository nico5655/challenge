Array is now 1 3  *   * . Segment with maximum sum 4 consists of two integers 1 3.  First element is destroyed. Array is now  *  3  *   * . Segment with maximum sum 3 consists of one integer 3.  Last element is destroyed. At this moment there are no valid nonempty segments left in this array, so the answer is equal to 0. ",
    "prob_desc_description": "You are given an array consisting of n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an.You are going to destroy integers in the array one by one. Thus, you are given the permutation of integers from 1 to n defining the order elements of the array are destroyed.After each element is destroyed you have to find out the segment of the array, such that it contains no destroyed elements and the sum of its elements is maximum possible. The sum of elements in the empty segment is considered to be 0.",

The third line contains a permutation of integers from 1 to n — the order used to destroy elements.",
