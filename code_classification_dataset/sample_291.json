Note that you cannot make non-positive numbers using such operations.You have to perform the minimum number of such operations in order to obtain three integers $$$A \\le B \\le C$$$ such that $$$B$$$ is divisible by $$$A$$$ and $$$C$$$ is divisible by $$$B$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.
