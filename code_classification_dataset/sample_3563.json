The polygon description is following: n lines containing coordinates of the vertices in clockwise order (integer x and y not greater than 109 by absolute value). It is guaranteed that the given polygon is nondegenerate and convex (no three points lie on the same line). The next line contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) — the number of points which you should count the answer for. It is followed by t lines with coordinates of the points (integer x and y not greater than 109 by absolute value).",
