    "prob_desc_description": "Vasya is studying in the last class of school and soon he will take exams. He decided to study polynomials. Polynomial is a function P(x) = a0 + a1x1 + ... + anxn. Numbers ai are called coefficients of a polynomial, non-negative integer n is called a degree of a polynomial.Vasya has made a bet with his friends that he can solve any problem with polynomials. They suggested him the problem: \"Determine how many polynomials P(x) exist with integer non-negative coefficients so that , and , where  and b are given positive integers\"? Vasya does not like losing bets, but he has no idea how to solve this task, so please help him to solve the problem.",
