    "prob_desc_description": "Furlo and Rublo play a game. The table has n piles of coins lying on it, the i-th pile has ai coins. Furlo and Rublo move in turns, Furlo moves first. In one move you are allowed to:  choose some pile, let's denote the current number of coins in it as x;  choose some integer y (0 ≤ y &lt; x; x1 / 4 ≤ y ≤ x1 / 2) and decrease the number of coins in this pile to y. In other words, after the described move the pile will have y coins left. The player who can't make a move, loses. Your task is to find out, who wins in the given game if both Furlo and Rublo play optimally well.",

The numbers are separated by single spaces. Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.",
