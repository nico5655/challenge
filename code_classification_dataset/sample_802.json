In the second example, one of configurations that we can't reach is $$$0$$$ written on $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$1$$$ written on $$$(2, 3)$$$.  Below you can see graphs from examples $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$:    ",
    "prob_desc_description": "Note that this is the first problem of the two similar problems. You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems.You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes. In the beginning, $$$0$$$ is written on all edges. In one operation, you can choose any $$$2$$$ distinct leaves $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ and any real number $$$x$$$ and add $$$x$$$ to values written on all edges on the simple path between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.For example, on the picture below you can see the result of applying two operations to the graph: adding $$$2$$$ on the path from $$$7$$$ to $$$6$$$, and then adding $$$-0.5$$$ on the path from $$$4$$$ to $$$5$$$.   Is it true that for any configuration of real numbers written on edges, we can achieve it with a finite number of operations?Leaf is a node of a tree of degree $$$1$$$. Simple path is a path that doesn't contain any node twice.",

Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$), meaning that there is an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.
