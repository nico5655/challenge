    "prob_desc_description": "Recently Vasya learned that, given two points with different $$$x$$$ coordinates, you can draw through them exactly one parabola with equation of type $$$y = x^2 + bx + c$$$, where $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are reals. Let's call such a parabola an $$$U$$$-shaped one.Vasya drew several distinct points with integer coordinates on a plane and then drew an $$$U$$$-shaped parabola through each pair of the points that have different $$$x$$$ coordinates. The picture became somewhat messy, but Vasya still wants to count how many of the parabolas drawn don't have any drawn point inside their internal area. Help Vasya.The internal area of an $$$U$$$-shaped parabola is the part of the plane that lies strictly above the parabola when the $$$y$$$ axis is directed upwards.",
