    "prob_desc_description": "Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has $$$s$$$ burles on his card. Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number $$$1 \\le x \\le s$$$, buy food that costs exactly $$$x$$$ burles and obtain $$$\\lfloor\\frac{x}{10}\\rfloor$$$ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends $$$x$$$ burles and obtains $$$\\lfloor\\frac{x}{10}\\rfloor$$$ back). The operation $$$\\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\rfloor$$$ means $$$a$$$ divided by $$$b$$$ rounded down.It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs $$$x$$$ for any possible value of $$$x$$$.Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.For example, if Mishka has $$$s=19$$$ burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is $$$21$$$. Firstly, he can spend $$$x=10$$$ burles, obtain $$$1$$$ burle as a cashback. Now he has $$$s=10$$$ burles, so can spend $$$x=10$$$ burles, obtain $$$1$$$ burle as a cashback and spend it too.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
