    "prob_desc_description": "Igor has fallen in love with Tanya. Now Igor wants to show his feelings and write a number on the fence opposite to Tanya's house. Igor thinks that the larger the number is, the more chance to win Tanya's heart he has. Unfortunately, Igor could only get v liters of paint. He did the math and concluded that digit d requires ad liters of paint. Besides, Igor heard that Tanya doesn't like zeroes. That's why Igor won't use them in his number.Help Igor find the maximum number he can write on the fence.",
