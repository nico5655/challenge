The bishop is not placed on the edges of the board. (In other words, the row and column of the bishop are between $$$2$$$ and $$$7$$$, inclusive.)The bishop attacks in all directions diagonally, and there is no limit to the distance which the bishop can attack. Note that the cell on which the bishop is placed is also considered attacked.     An example of a bishop on a chessboard. The squares it attacks are marked in red. Mihai has marked all squares the bishop attacks, but forgot where the bishop was! Help Mihai find the position of the bishop.",

There is an empty line before each test case. Each test case consists of $$$8$$$ lines, each containing $$$8$$$ characters. Each of these characters is either '#' or '.', denoting a square under attack and a square not under attack, respectively.",
