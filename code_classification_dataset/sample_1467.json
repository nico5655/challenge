It's possible to draw a line that passes through points 1, 3, 5, and another one that passes through points 2, 4 and is parallel to the first one.In the second example, while it's possible to draw two lines that cover all points, they cannot be made parallel.In the third example, it's impossible to satisfy both requirements at the same time.",
