The guest should have at least five free chairs to his left, and at least six free chairs to his right to the next person, which is in this case the guest herself. So, overall number of chairs should be at least 6+1=7.",

You can make any number of circles. Your guests happen to be a little bit shy, so the $$$i$$$-th guest wants to have a least $$$l_i$$$ free chairs to the left of his chair, and at least $$$r_i$$$ free chairs to the right. The \"left\" and \"right\" directions are chosen assuming all guests are going to be seated towards the center of the circle.
