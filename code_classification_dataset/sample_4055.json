Each consecutive pair has an even sum now. Hence, we only need to remove $$$1$$$ element to satisfy the condition asked.In the second test case, each consecutive pair already has an even sum so we need not remove any element.",

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i\\leq10^9$$$) — elements of the sequence.
