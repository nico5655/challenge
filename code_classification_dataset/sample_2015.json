Every time he finishes the page with the number divisible by $$$m$$$, he writes down the last digit of this page number. For example, if $$$n=15$$$ and $$$m=5$$$, pages divisible by $$$m$$$ are $$$5, 10, 15$$$. Their last digits are $$$5, 0, 5$$$ correspondingly, their sum is $$$10$$$.Your task is to calculate the sum of all digits Polycarp has written down.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.",
