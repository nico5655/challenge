Using an operation of the third type with $$$k=8$$$, the current pair would be equal to $$$(-7, 9)$$$.  Using an operation of the second type with $$$k=7$$$, the current pair would be equal to $$$(0, 2)$$$.  Using an operation of the first type with $$$k=3$$$, the current pair would be equal to $$$(3, 5)$$$. ",
    "prob_desc_description": "  William has two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ initially both equal to zero. William mastered performing three different operations with them quickly. Before performing each operation some positive integer $$$k$$$ is picked, which is then used to perform one of the following operations: (note, that for each operation you can choose a new positive integer $$$k$$$)  add number $$$k$$$ to both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, or  add number $$$k$$$ to $$$a$$$ and subtract $$$k$$$ from $$$b$$$, or  add number $$$k$$$ to $$$b$$$ and subtract $$$k$$$ from $$$a$$$. Note that after performing operations, numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ may become negative as well.William wants to find out the minimal number of operations he would have to perform to make $$$a$$$ equal to his favorite number $$$c$$$ and $$$b$$$ equal to his second favorite number $$$d$$$.",
