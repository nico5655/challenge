In one move you can go to any of the four adjacent points (left, right, up, down).More formally, if you are standing at the point $$$(x, y)$$$, you can:   go left, and move to $$$(x - 1, y)$$$, or  go right, and move to $$$(x + 1, y)$$$, or  go up, and move to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$, or  go down, and move to $$$(x, y - 1)$$$. There are $$$n$$$ boxes on this plane. The $$$i$$$-th box has coordinates $$$(x_i,y_i)$$$. It is guaranteed that the boxes are either on the $$$x$$$-axis or the $$$y$$$-axis. That is, either $$$x_i=0$$$ or $$$y_i=0$$$.You can collect a box if you and the box are at the same point. Find the minimum number of moves you have to perform to collect all of these boxes if you have to start and finish at the point $$$(0,0)$$$.",

The $$$i$$$-th line of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-100 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 100$$$) — the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th box.
