    "prob_desc_description": "A new entertainment has appeared in Buryatia — a mathematical circus! The magician shows two numbers to the audience — $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, where $$$n$$$ is even. Next, he takes all the integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and splits them all into pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ (each integer must be in exactly one pair) so that for each pair the integer $$$(a + k) \\cdot b$$$ is divisible by $$$4$$$ (note that the order of the numbers in the pair matters), or reports that, unfortunately for viewers, such a split is impossible.Burenka really likes such performances, so she asked her friend Tonya to be a magician, and also gave him the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.Tonya is a wolf, and as you know, wolves do not perform in the circus, even in a mathematical one. Therefore, he asks you to help him. Let him know if a suitable splitting into pairs is possible, and if possible, then tell it.",
