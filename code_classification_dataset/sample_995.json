So the answer is two.In the second test case, you can buy a subscription to any show because for each show you can find a segment of three consecutive days, consisting only of episodes of this show.In the third test case in the unique segment of four days, you have four different shows, so you need to buy a subscription to all these four shows.In the fourth test case, you can buy subscriptions to shows $$$3,5,7,8,9$$$, and you will be able to watch shows for the last eight days.",
    "prob_desc_description": "The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the $$$k$$$ TV shows. You know the schedule for the next $$$n$$$ days: a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le k$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the show, the episode of which will be shown in $$$i$$$-th day.The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately.How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \\le d \\le n$$$) days in a row? In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of $$$d$$$ consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.",

The answer to a test case is the minimum number of TV shows for which you need to purchase a subscription so that you can watch episodes of the purchased TV shows on BerTV for $$$d$$$ consecutive days. Please note that it is permissible that you will be able to watch more than $$$d$$$ days in a row.",

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le k$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the show that is broadcasted on the $$$i$$$-th day.
