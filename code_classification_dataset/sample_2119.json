    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case of the example, we can perform the following sequence of moves:  choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ and remove $$$a_i$$$ (so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2; 2]$$$);  choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$ and remove $$$a_j$$$ (so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2]$$$). In the second test case of the example, we can choose any possible $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ any move and it doesn't matter which element we remove.In the third test case of the example, there is no way to get rid of $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$.",
    "prob_desc_description": "You are given the array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive (greater than zero) integers.In one move, you can choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \\ne j$$$) such that the absolute difference between $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is no more than one ($$$|a_i - a_j| \\le 1$$$) and remove the smallest of these two elements. If two elements are equal, you can remove any of them (but exactly one).Your task is to find if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) such moves or not.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
