    "prob_desc_description": "Vasya wrote down two strings s of length n and t of length m consisting of small English letters 'a' and 'b'. What is more, he knows that string t has a form \"abab...\", namely there are letters 'a' on odd positions and letters 'b' on even positions.Suddenly in the morning, Vasya found that somebody spoiled his string. Some letters of the string s were replaced by character '?'.Let's call a sequence of positions i, i + 1, ..., i + m - 1 as occurrence of string t in s, if 1 ≤ i ≤ n - m + 1 and t1 = si, t2 = si + 1, ..., tm = si + m - 1.The boy defines the beauty of the string s as maximum number of disjoint occurrences of string t in s. Vasya can replace some letters '?' with 'a' or 'b' (letters on different positions can be replaced with different letter). Vasya wants to make some replacements in such a way that beauty of string s is maximum possible. From all such options, he wants to choose one with the minimum number of replacements. Find the number of replacements he should make.",
