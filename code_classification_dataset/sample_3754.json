He will perform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty: select an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$ and $$$a_i$$$ is not divisible by $$$(i + 1)$$$, and erase this element from the sequence. Here $$$|a|$$$ is the length of sequence $$$a$$$ at the moment of operation. Note that the sequence $$$a$$$ changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.For example, if $$$a=[3,5,4,5]$$$, then he can select $$$i = 2$$$, because $$$a_2 = 5$$$ is not divisible by $$$i+1 = 3$$$. After this operation the sequence is $$$[3,4,5]$$$.Help YouKn0wWho determine if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation.",
