In the second test case, no matter which operations you choose, the resulting score is $$$16$$$.In the third test case, one way to obtain a score of $$$0$$$ is the following one:  choose $$$a_1 = 1$$$ and $$$a_2 = 3$$$ for the operation; the score becomes $$$0 + \\lfloor \\frac{1}{3} \\rfloor = 0$$$, the array becomes $$$[3, 7]$$$;  choose $$$a_1 = 3$$$ and $$$a_2 = 7$$$ for the operation; the score becomes $$$0 + \\lfloor \\frac{3}{7} \\rfloor = 0$$$, the array becomes empty;  the array is empty, so the score doesn't change anymore. In the fourth test case, no operations can be performed, so the score is the sum of the elements of the array: $$$4 + 2 = 6$$$.",

In one operation, you have to choose two elements of the array (let them be $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$; they can be equal or different, but their positions in the array must not be the same), remove them from the array, and add $$$\\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{a_j} \\rfloor$$$ to your score, where $$$\\lfloor \\frac{x}{y} \\rfloor$$$ is the maximum integer not exceeding $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$.Initially, your score is $$$0$$$.
