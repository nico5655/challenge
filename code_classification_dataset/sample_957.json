    "prob_desc_description": "In this problem we consider a very simplified model of Barcelona city.Barcelona can be represented as a plane with streets of kind $$$x = c$$$ and $$$y = c$$$ for every integer $$$c$$$ (that is, the rectangular grid). However, there is a detail which makes Barcelona different from Manhattan. There is an avenue called Avinguda Diagonal which can be represented as a the set of points $$$(x, y)$$$ for which $$$ax + by + c = 0$$$.One can walk along streets, including the avenue. You are given two integer points $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ somewhere in Barcelona. Find the minimal possible distance one needs to travel to get to $$$B$$$ from $$$A$$$.",

Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\\frac{|a - b|}{\\max{(1, |b|)}} \\le 10^{-6}$$$.",
