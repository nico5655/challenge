    "prob_desc_description": "  William arrived at a conference dedicated to cryptocurrencies. Networking, meeting new people, and using friends' connections are essential to stay up to date with the latest news from the world of cryptocurrencies.The conference has $$$n$$$ participants, who are initially unfamiliar with each other. William can introduce any two people, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, who were not familiar before, to each other. William has $$$d$$$ conditions, $$$i$$$'th of which requires person $$$x_i$$$ to have a connection to person $$$y_i$$$. Formally, two people $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ have a connection if there is such a chain $$$p_1=x, p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_k=y$$$ for which for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k - 1$$$ it's true that two people with numbers $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_{i + 1}$$$ know each other.For every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le d$$$) William wants you to calculate the maximal number of acquaintances one person can have, assuming that William satisfied all conditions from $$$1$$$ and up to and including $$$i$$$ and performed exactly $$$i$$$ introductions. The conditions are being checked after William performed $$$i$$$ introductions. The answer for each $$$i$$$ must be calculated independently. It means that when you compute an answer for $$$i$$$, you should assume that no two people have been introduced to each other yet.",
