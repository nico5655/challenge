    "prob_desc_description": "It is given a positive integer $$$n$$$. In $$$1$$$ move, one can select any single digit and remove it (i.e. one selects some position in the number and removes the digit located at this position). The operation cannot be performed if only one digit remains. If the resulting number contains leading zeroes, they are automatically removed.E.g. if one removes from the number $$$32925$$$ the $$$3$$$-rd digit, the resulting number will be $$$3225$$$. If one removes from the number $$$20099050$$$ the first digit, the resulting number will be $$$99050$$$ (the $$$2$$$ zeroes going next to the first digit are automatically removed).What is the minimum number of steps to get a number such that it is divisible by $$$25$$$ and positive? It is guaranteed that, for each $$$n$$$ occurring in the input, the answer exists. It is guaranteed that the number $$$n$$$ has no leading zeros.",
