    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first testcase, you can choose substrings \"0\", \"1\" or \"01\". In \"0\" the amount of '0' is $$$1$$$, the amount of '1' is $$$0$$$. '1' is a strict minority, thus all occurrences of it are removed from the substring. However, since there were $$$0$$$ of them, nothing changes. Same for \"1\". And in \"01\" neither of '0' or '1' is a strict minority. Thus, nothing changes. So there is no way to remove any characters.In the second testcase, you can choose substring \"10101010101\". It contains $$$5$$$ characters '0' and $$$6$$$ characters '1'. '0' is a strict minority. Thus, you can remove all its occurrences. There exist other substrings that produce the same answer.In the third testcase, you can choose substring \"011000100\". It contains $$$6$$$ characters '0' and $$$3$$$ characters '1'. '1' is a strict minority. Thus, you can remove all its occurrences.",
    "prob_desc_description": "You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.You have to choose a contiguous substring of $$$s$$$ and remove all occurrences of the character, which is a strict minority in it, from the substring.That is, if the amount of '0's in the substring is strictly smaller than the amount of '1's, remove all occurrences of '0' from the substring. If the amount of '1's is strictly smaller than the amount of '0's, remove all occurrences of '1'. If the amounts are the same, do nothing.You have to apply the operation exactly once.
