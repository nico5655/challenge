    "prob_desc_description": "For an array $$$a$$$ of integers let's denote its maximal element as $$$\\max(a)$$$, and minimal as $$$\\min(a)$$$. We will call an array $$$a$$$ of $$$k$$$ integers interesting if $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a) \\ge k$$$. For example, array $$$[1, 3, 4, 3]$$$ isn't interesting as $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a) = 4 - 1 = 3 &lt; 4$$$ while array $$$[7, 3, 0, 4, 3]$$$ is as $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a) = 7 - 0 = 7 \\ge 5$$$.You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. Find some interesting nonempty subarray of $$$a$$$, or tell that it doesn't exist.An array $$$b$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.",

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).",

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
