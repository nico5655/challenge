    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case, Alice and Bob can each take one candy, then both will have a total weight of $$$1$$$.In the second test case, any division will be unfair.In the third test case, both Alice and Bob can take two candies, one of weight $$$1$$$ and one of weight $$$2$$$.In the fourth test case, it is impossible to divide three identical candies between two people.In the fifth test case, any division will also be unfair.",
    "prob_desc_description": "Alice and Bob received $$$n$$$ candies from their parents. Each candy weighs either 1 gram or 2 grams. Now they want to divide all candies among themselves fairly so that the total weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total weight of Bob's candies.Check if they can do that.Note that candies are not allowed to be cut in half.",

The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ — the weights of the candies. The weight of each candy is either $$$1$$$ or $$$2$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.",
