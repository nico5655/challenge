Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You are given the values $$$p_i$$$ â€” the index of the router to which the $$$i$$$-th router was connected after being purchased ($$$p_i &lt; i$$$).There are $$$n$$$ routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the $$$n$$$-th router.",
