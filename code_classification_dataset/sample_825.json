Thus he will obtain the sequence \"GGGGGGGSGS\", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $$$7$$$. In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $$$4$$$. In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $$$0$$$.",

The trophies are arranged in a row.The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies.
