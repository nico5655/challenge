    "prob_desc_description": "After the mysterious disappearance of Ashish, his two favourite disciples Ishika and Hriday, were each left with one half of a secret message. These messages can each be represented by a permutation of size $$$n$$$. Let's call them $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Note that a permutation of $$$n$$$ elements is a sequence of numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, in which every number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. The message can be decoded by an arrangement of sequence $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, such that the number of matching pairs of elements between them is maximum. A pair of elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_j$$$ is said to match if:   $$$i = j$$$, that is, they are at the same index.  $$$a_i = b_j$$$ His two disciples are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:   choose a number $$$k$$$ and cyclically shift one of the permutations to the left or right $$$k$$$ times. A single cyclic shift to the left on any permutation $$$c$$$ is an operation that sets $$$c_1:=c_2, c_2:=c_3, \\ldots, c_n:=c_1$$$ simultaneously. Likewise, a single cyclic shift to the right on any permutation $$$c$$$ is an operation that sets $$$c_1:=c_n, c_2:=c_1, \\ldots, c_n:=c_{n-1}$$$ simultaneously.Help Ishika and Hriday find the maximum number of pairs of elements that match after performing the operation any (possibly zero) number of times.",
