He decided to buy her exactly $$$n$$$ flowers.Vladimir went to a flower shop, and he was amazed to see that there are $$$m$$$ types of flowers being sold there, and there is unlimited supply of flowers of each type. Vladimir wants to choose flowers to maximize the happiness of his wife. He knows that after receiving the first flower of the $$$i$$$-th type happiness of his wife increases by $$$a_i$$$ and after receiving each consecutive flower of this type her happiness increases by $$$b_i$$$. That is, if among the chosen flowers there are $$$x_i &gt; 0$$$ flowers of type $$$i$$$, his wife gets $$$a_i + (x_i - 1) \\cdot b_i$$$ additional happiness (and if there are no flowers of type $$$i$$$, she gets nothing for this particular type).Please help Vladimir to choose exactly $$$n$$$ flowers to maximize the total happiness of his wife.",
