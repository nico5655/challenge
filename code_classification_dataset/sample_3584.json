In order to accomplish his goal, he can pick two consecutive heroes, with powers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$, remove them and insert a hero with power $$$-(a_i+a_{i+1})$$$ back in the same position. For example if the array contains the elements $$$[5, 6, 7, 8]$$$, he can pick $$$6$$$ and $$$7$$$ and get $$$[5, -(6+7), 8] = [5, -13, 8]$$$.After he will perform this operation $$$n-1$$$ times, Mans will end up having only one hero. He wants his power to be as big as possible. What's the largest possible power he can achieve?",
