    "prob_desc_description": "You are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. You can perform two types of operations:   Pay $$$a$$$ dollars and increase or decrease any of these integers by $$$1$$$. For example, if $$$x = 0$$$ and $$$y = 7$$$ there are four possible outcomes after this operation:   $$$x = 0$$$, $$$y = 6$$$;  $$$x = 0$$$, $$$y = 8$$$;  $$$x = -1$$$, $$$y = 7$$$;  $$$x = 1$$$, $$$y = 7$$$.   Pay $$$b$$$ dollars and increase or decrease both integers by $$$1$$$. For example, if $$$x = 0$$$ and $$$y = 7$$$ there are two possible outcomes after this operation:   $$$x = -1$$$, $$$y = 6$$$;  $$$x = 1$$$, $$$y = 8$$$.  Your goal is to make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. $$$x = y = 0$$$. There are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from $$$x=1$$$, $$$y=0$$$ to $$$x=y=0$$$.Calculate the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend on it.",
