Each item is described by its price ci and time ti in seconds that a checkout assistant spends on this item. While the checkout assistant is occupied with some item, Bob can steal some other items from his trolley. To steal one item Bob needs exactly 1 second. What is the minimum amount of money that Bob will have to pay to the checkout assistant? Remember, please, that it is Bob, who determines the order of items for the checkout assistant.",
