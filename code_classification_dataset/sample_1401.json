    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first query the first and the second segments should be in different groups, but exact numbers don't matter.In the second query the third segment intersects with the first and the second segments, so they should be in the same group, but then the other group becomes empty, so answer is $$$-1$$$.In the third query we can distribute segments in any way that makes groups non-empty, so any answer of $$$6$$$ possible is correct.",
    "prob_desc_description": "There are $$$n$$$ segments $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$ for $$$1 \\le i \\le n$$$. You should divide all segments into two non-empty groups in such way that there is no pair of segments from different groups which have at least one common point, or say that it's impossible to do it. Each segment should belong to exactly one group.To optimize testing process you will be given multitest.",

It is guaranteed that $$$\\sum{n}$$$ over all queries does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. The next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ per line ($$$1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the $$$i$$$-th segment.",
