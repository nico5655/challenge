For example, you can replace $$$30$$$ with $$$15$$$ using the first operation, with $$$20$$$ using the second operation or with $$$24$$$ using the third operation.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain $$$1$$$ from $$$n$$$ or say that it is impossible to do it.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.",
