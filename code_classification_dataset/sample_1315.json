Now $$$n = 1$$$, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.In the third test case, $$$n = 3$$$, Ashishgup divides by $$$3$$$ on the first move. Now $$$n = 1$$$, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.In the last test case, $$$n = 12$$$, Ashishgup divides it by $$$3$$$. Now $$$n = 4$$$, FastestFinger is forced to subtract $$$1$$$, and Ashishgup gets $$$3$$$, so he wins by dividing it by $$$3$$$.",

In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:  Divide $$$n$$$ by any of its odd divisors greater than $$$1$$$.  Subtract $$$1$$$ from $$$n$$$ if $$$n$$$ is greater than $$$1$$$.
