In the second test case, Vasya has only $$$1$$$ burle coins, and he can collect either any amount from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$, but $$$5$$$ can't.  In the second test case, Vasya has only $$$2$$$ burle coins, and he cannot pay $$$1$$$ burle without change.  In the fourth test case you don't have any coins, and he can't even pay $$$1$$$ burle. ",
    "prob_desc_description": "Vasya decided to go to the grocery store. He found in his wallet $$$a$$$ coins of $$$1$$$ burle and $$$b$$$ coins of $$$2$$$ burles. He does not yet know the total cost of all goods, so help him find out $$$s$$$ ($$$s &gt; 0$$$): the minimum positive integer amount of money he cannot pay without change or pay at all using only his coins.For example, if $$$a=1$$$ and $$$b=1$$$ (he has one $$$1$$$-burle coin and one $$$2$$$-burle coin), then:  he can pay $$$1$$$ burle without change, paying with one $$$1$$$-burle coin,  he can pay $$$2$$$ burle without change, paying with one $$$2$$$-burle coin,  he can pay $$$3$$$ burle without change by paying with one $$$1$$$-burle coin and one $$$2$$$-burle coin,  he cannot pay $$$4$$$ burle without change (moreover, he cannot pay this amount at all). So for $$$a=1$$$ and $$$b=1$$$ the answer is $$$s=4$$$.",
