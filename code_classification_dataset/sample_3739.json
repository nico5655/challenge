Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is $$$1$$$;  in the second test case, it's possible to remove three characters from the beginning and six characters from the end. Two characters 0 remain, three characters 1 are deleted, so the cost is $$$3$$$;  in the third test case, it's optimal to remove four characters from the beginning;  in the fourth test case, it's optimal to remove the whole string;  in the fifth test case, it's optimal to leave the string as it is.
