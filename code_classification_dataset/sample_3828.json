    "prob_desc_description": "You are playing a game on a $$$n \\times m$$$ grid, in which the computer has selected some cell $$$(x, y)$$$ of the grid, and you have to determine which one. To do so, you will choose some $$$k$$$ and some $$$k$$$ cells $$$(x_1, y_1),\\, (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_k, y_k)$$$, and give them to the computer. In response, you will get $$$k$$$ numbers $$$b_1,\\, b_2, \\ldots b_k$$$, where $$$b_i$$$ is the manhattan distance from $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ to the hidden cell $$$(x, y)$$$ (so you know which distance corresponds to which of $$$k$$$ input cells). After receiving these $$$b_1,\\, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$$$, you have to be able to determine the hidden cell. What is the smallest $$$k$$$ for which is it possible to always guess the hidden cell correctly, no matter what cell computer chooses?As a reminder, the manhattan distance between cells $$$(a_1, b_1)$$$ and $$$(a_2, b_2)$$$ is equal to $$$|a_1-a_2|+|b_1-b_2|$$$.",
