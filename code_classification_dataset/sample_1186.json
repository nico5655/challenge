However, as a result of this operation, value of $$$a$$$ cannot become less than $$$x$$$, and value of $$$b$$$ cannot become less than $$$y$$$. Your task is to find the minimum possible product of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$a \\cdot b$$$) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than $$$n$$$ times.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
