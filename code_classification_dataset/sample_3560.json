Today, he has been tasked with evaluating the level of happiness in the company.There are $$$n$$$ people working for VoltModder, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each employee earns a different amount of money in the company — initially, the $$$i$$$-th person earns $$$i$$$ rubles per day.On each of $$$q$$$ following days, the salaries will be revised. At the end of the $$$i$$$-th day, employee $$$v_i$$$ will start earning $$$n+i$$$ rubles per day and will become the best-paid person in the company. The employee will keep his new salary until it gets revised again.Some pairs of people don't like each other. This creates a great psychological danger in the company. Formally, if two people $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ dislike each other and $$$a$$$ earns more money than $$$b$$$, employee $$$a$$$ will brag about this to $$$b$$$. A dangerous triple is a triple of three employees $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, such that $$$a$$$ brags to $$$b$$$, who in turn brags to $$$c$$$. If $$$a$$$ dislikes $$$b$$$, then $$$b$$$ dislikes $$$a$$$.At the beginning of each day, Konrad needs to evaluate the number of dangerous triples in the company. Can you help him do it?",
