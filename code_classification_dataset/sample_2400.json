    "prob_desc_description": "Of course you have heard the famous task about Hanoi Towers, but did you know that there is a special factory producing the rings for this wonderful game? Once upon a time, the ruler of the ancient Egypt ordered the workers of Hanoi Factory to create as high tower as possible. They were not ready to serve such a strange order so they had to create this new tower using already produced rings.There are n rings in factory's stock. The i-th ring has inner radius ai, outer radius bi and height hi. The goal is to select some subset of rings and arrange them such that the following conditions are satisfied:  Outer radiuses form a non-increasing sequence, i.e. one can put the j-th ring on the i-th ring only if bj ≤ bi.  Rings should not fall one into the the other. That means one can place ring j on the ring i only if bj &gt; ai.  The total height of all rings used should be maximum possible. ",
