    "prob_desc_description": "Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves first.Consider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at $$$(0,0)$$$. In one move a player must increase either the $$$x$$$ coordinate or the $$$y$$$ coordinate of the token by exactly $$$k$$$. In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance $$$d$$$ from $$$(0,0)$$$.In other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are $$$(p,q)$$$, then $$$p^2 + q^2 \\leq d^2$$$ must hold.The game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.",
