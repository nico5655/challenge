    "prob_desc_description": "Lesha plays the recently published new version of the legendary game hacknet. In this version character skill mechanism was introduced. Now, each player character has exactly n skills. Each skill is represented by a non-negative integer ai — the current skill level. All skills have the same maximum level A.Along with the skills, global ranking of all players was added. Players are ranked according to the so-called Force. The Force of a player is the sum of the following values:  The number of skills that a character has perfected (i.e., such that ai = A), multiplied by coefficient cf. The minimum skill level among all skills (min ai), multiplied by coefficient cm. Now Lesha has m hacknetian currency units, which he is willing to spend. Each currency unit can increase the current level of any skill by 1 (if it's not equal to A yet). Help him spend his money in order to achieve the maximum possible value of the Force.",
    "prob_desc_output_spec": "On the first line print the maximum value of the Force that the character can achieve using no more than m currency units. On the second line print n integers a'i (ai ≤ a'i ≤ A), skill levels which one must achieve in order to reach the specified value of the Force, while using no more than m currency units. Numbers should be separated by spaces.",
