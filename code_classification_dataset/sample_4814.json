    "prob_desc_description": "Vupsen and Pupsen were gifted an integer array. Since Vupsen doesn't like the number $$$0$$$, he threw away all numbers equal to $$$0$$$ from the array. As a result, he got an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.Pupsen, on the contrary, likes the number $$$0$$$ and he got upset when he saw the array without zeroes. To cheer Pupsen up, Vupsen decided to come up with another array $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i \\cdot b_i=0$$$. Since Vupsen doesn't like number $$$0$$$, the array $$$b$$$ must not contain numbers equal to $$$0$$$. Also, the numbers in that array must not be huge, so the sum of their absolute values cannot exceed $$$10^9$$$. Please help Vupsen to find any such array $$$b$$$!",
