You arrived at the pool in $$$9$$$ minutes after the start time and in a minute you will meet the first swimmer on the left side.In the second test case, the first swimmer is on the left side in $$$0, 6, 12, 18, \\ldots$$$ minutes after the start time, the second swimmer is on the left side in $$$0, 10, 20, 30, \\ldots$$$ minutes after the start time, and the third swimmer is on the left side in $$$0, 9, 18, 27, \\ldots$$$ minutes after the start time. You arrived at the pool $$$2$$$ minutes after the start time and after $$$4$$$ minutes meet the first swimmer on the left side.In the third test case, you came to the pool $$$10$$$ minutes after the start time. At the same time, all three swimmers are on the left side. A rare stroke of luck!In the fourth test case, all swimmers are located on the left side in $$$0, 9, 18, 27, \\ldots$$$ minutes after the start time.

At noon, they started to swim from the left side of the pool.It takes the first swimmer exactly $$$a$$$ minutes to swim across the entire pool and come back, exactly $$$b$$$ minutes for the second swimmer and $$$c$$$ minutes for the third. Hence, the first swimmer will be on the left side of the pool after $$$0$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$2a$$$, $$$3a$$$, ... minutes after the start time, the second one will be at $$$0$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$2b$$$, $$$3b$$$, ... minutes, and the third one will be on the left side of the pool after $$$0$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$2c$$$, $$$3c$$$, ... minutes.You came to the left side of the pool exactly $$$p$$$ minutes after they started swimming.
