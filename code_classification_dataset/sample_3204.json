All boxers have different strength from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and boxer $$$i$$$ wins in the match against boxer $$$j$$$ if and only if $$$i$$$ is stronger than $$$j$$$.The tournament will be organized as follows: $$$n$$$ boxers will be divided into pairs; the loser in each pair leaves the tournament, and $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$ winners advance to the next stage, where they are divided into pairs again, and the winners in all pairs advance to the next stage, and so on, until only one boxer remains (who is declared the winner).Your friend really wants to win the tournament, but he may be not the strongest boxer. To help your friend win the tournament, you may bribe his opponents: if your friend is fighting with a boxer you have bribed, your friend wins even if his strength is lower.Furthermore, during each stage you distribute the boxers into pairs as you wish.The boxer with strength $$$i$$$ can be bribed if you pay him $$$a_i$$$ dollars.
