    "prob_desc_description": "The polar bears are going fishing. They plan to sail from (sx, sy) to (ex, ey). However, the boat can only sail by wind. At each second, the wind blows in one of these directions: east, south, west or north. Assume the boat is currently at (x, y).  If the wind blows to the east, the boat will move to (x + 1, y).  If the wind blows to the south, the boat will move to (x, y - 1).  If the wind blows to the west, the boat will move to (x - 1, y).  If the wind blows to the north, the boat will move to (x, y + 1). Alternatively, they can hold the boat by the anchor. In this case, the boat stays at (x, y). Given the wind direction for t seconds, what is the earliest time they sail to (ex, ey)?",

The second line contains t characters, the i-th character is the wind blowing direction at the i-th second.
