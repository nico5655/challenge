Tonight he entered a bar and saw n people sitting there. For every one of them Vasya happened to determine either the age or the drink the person is having. Vasya can check any person, i.e. learn his age and the drink he is having at the same time. What minimal number of people should Vasya check additionally to make sure that there are no clients under 18 having alcohol drinks?The list of all alcohol drinks in Berland is: ABSINTH, BEER, BRANDY, CHAMPAGNE, GIN, RUM, SAKE, TEQUILA, VODKA, WHISKEY, WINE",
