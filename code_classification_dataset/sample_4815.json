Then the difference will be equal to $$$0$$$.In the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs and a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two three-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert will be $$$1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7$$$, the duration of the second concert will be $$$6$$$. The difference of them is $$$|7-6| = 1$$$.",
