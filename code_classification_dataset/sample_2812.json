Since $$$\\max(k - 2, 1)$$$ is equal to $$$1$$$, the value of the subsequence is $$$2^0 + 2^1$$$ (both $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ have $$$1$$$-st bit set in their binary representation and $$$3$$$ has $$$0$$$-th bit set in its binary representation). Note that he could also pick the subsequence $$$\\{{3\\}}$$$ or $$$\\{{2, 1, 3\\}}$$$.For the second test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $$$\\{{3, 4\\}}$$$ with value $$$7$$$.For the third test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $$$\\{{1\\}}$$$ with value $$$1$$$.For the fourth test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $$$\\{{7, 7\\}}$$$ with value $$$7$$$.",
