He also knows exactly $$$m$$$ pairs of colors which harmonize with each other.Ivan also enjoy playing chess. He has $$$5000$$$ rooks. He wants to take $$$k$$$ rooks, paint each of them in one of $$$n$$$ colors and then place this $$$k$$$ rooks on a chessboard of size $$$10^{9} \\times 10^{9}$$$.Let's call the set of rooks on the board connected if from any rook we can get to any other rook in this set moving only through cells with rooks from this set. Assume that rooks can jump over other rooks, in other words a rook can go to any cell which shares vertical and to any cell which shares horizontal.Ivan wants his arrangement of rooks to have following properties: For any color there is a rook of this color on a board; For any color the set of rooks of this color is connected; For any two different colors $$$a$$$ $$$b$$$ union of set of rooks of color $$$a$$$ and set of rooks of color $$$b$$$ is connected if and only if this two colors harmonize with each other.Please help Ivan find such an arrangement.",
