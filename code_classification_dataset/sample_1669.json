    "prob_desc_description": "Polycarp loves geometric progressions very much. Since he was only three years old, he loves only the progressions of length three. He also has a favorite integer k and a sequence a, consisting of n integers.He wants to know how many subsequences of length three can be selected from a, so that they form a geometric progression with common ratio k.A subsequence of length three is a combination of three such indexes i1, i2, i3, that 1 ≤ i1 &lt; i2 &lt; i3 ≤ n. That is, a subsequence of length three are such groups of three elements that are not necessarily consecutive in the sequence, but their indexes are strictly increasing.A geometric progression with common ratio k is a sequence of numbers of the form b·k0, b·k1, ..., b·kr - 1.Polycarp is only three years old, so he can not calculate this number himself. Help him to do it.",
