    "prob_desc_description": "Arkady has a playlist that initially consists of $$$n$$$ songs, numerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in the order they appear in the playlist. Arkady starts listening to the songs in the playlist one by one, starting from song $$$1$$$. The playlist is cycled, i. e. after listening to the last song, Arkady will continue listening from the beginning.Each song has a genre $$$a_i$$$, which is a positive integer. Let Arkady finish listening to a song with genre $$$y$$$, and the genre of the next-to-last listened song be $$$x$$$. If $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y) = 1$$$, he deletes the last listened song (with genre $$$y$$$) from the playlist. After that he continues listening normally, skipping the deleted songs, and forgetting about songs he listened to before. In other words, after he deletes a song, he can't delete the next song immediately.Here $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.For example, if the initial songs' genres were $$$[5, 9, 2, 10, 15]$$$, then the playlist is converted as follows: [5, 9, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 9, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 2, 10, 15] (because $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(5, 9) = 1$$$) $$$\\to$$$ [5, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 10, 15] (because $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(5, 2) = 1$$$) $$$\\to$$$ [5, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ ... The bold numbers represent the two last played songs. Note that after a song is deleted, Arkady forgets that he listened to that and the previous songs.Given the initial playlist, please determine which songs are eventually deleted and the order these songs are deleted.",
