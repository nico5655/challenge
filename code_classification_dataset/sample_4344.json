The same two people can talk several (as many as they want) times per meeting.Each person has limited sociability. The sociability of the $$$i$$$-th person is a non-negative integer $$$a_i$$$. This means that after exactly $$$a_i$$$ talks this person leaves the meeting (and does not talk to anyone else anymore). If $$$a_i = 0$$$, the $$$i$$$-th person leaves the meeting immediately after it starts.A meeting is considered most productive if the maximum possible number of talks took place during it.You are given an array of sociability $$$a$$$, determine which people should talk to each other so that the total number of talks is as large as possible.",
    "prob_desc_output_spec": "Print $$$t$$$ answers to all test cases. On the first line of each answer print the number $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of talks possible in a meeting. On each of the next $$$k$$$ lines print two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \\le i, j \\le n$$$ and $$$i \\neq j$$$) — the numbers of people who will have another talk. If there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.",

The second line consists of $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the sociability parameters of all people.  It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all $$$a_i$$$ (over all test cases and all $$$i$$$) does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
