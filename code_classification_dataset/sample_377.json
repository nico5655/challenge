    "prob_desc_description": "After Fox Ciel got off a bus, she found that the bus she was on was a wrong bus and she lost her way in a strange town. However, she fortunately met her friend Beaver Taro and asked which way to go to her castle. Taro's response to her was a string s, and she tried to remember the string s correctly.However, Ciel feels n strings b1, b2, ... , bn are really boring, and unfortunately she dislikes to remember a string that contains a boring substring. To make the thing worse, what she can remember is only the contiguous substring of s.Determine the longest contiguous substring of s that does not contain any boring string, so that she can remember the longest part of Taro's response.",

Next n lines, there is a string bi (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Each length of bi will be between 1 and 10, inclusive. Each character of the given strings will be either a English alphabet (both lowercase and uppercase) or a underscore ('_') or a digit. Assume that these strings are case-sensitive.",
