    "prob_desc_description": "There are two sisters Alice and Betty. You have $$$n$$$ candies. You want to distribute these $$$n$$$ candies between two sisters in such a way that:  Alice will get $$$a$$$ ($$$a &gt; 0$$$) candies;  Betty will get $$$b$$$ ($$$b &gt; 0$$$) candies;  each sister will get some integer number of candies;  Alice will get a greater amount of candies than Betty (i.e. $$$a &gt; b$$$);  all the candies will be given to one of two sisters (i.e. $$$a+b=n$$$). Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly $$$n$$$ candies between sisters in a way described above. Candies are indistinguishable.Formally, find the number of ways to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of $$$n=a+b$$$, where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are positive integers and $$$a&gt;b$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.",
