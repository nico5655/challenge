    "prob_desc_description": "Let's call an array $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m$$$ of nonnegative integer numbers good if $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_m = 2\\cdot(a_1 \\oplus a_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus a_m)$$$, where $$$\\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.For example, array $$$[1, 2, 3, 6]$$$ is good, as $$$1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12 = 2\\cdot 6 = 2\\cdot (1\\oplus 2 \\oplus 3 \\oplus 6)$$$. At the same time, array $$$[1, 2, 1, 3]$$$ isn't good, as $$$1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7 \\neq 2\\cdot 1 = 2\\cdot(1\\oplus 2 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 3)$$$.You are given an array of length $$$n$$$: $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. Append at most $$$3$$$ elements to it to make it good. Appended elements don't have to be different. It can be shown that the solution always exists under the given constraints. If there are different solutions, you are allowed to output any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of added elements!. So, if an array is good already you are allowed to not append elements.",

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.
