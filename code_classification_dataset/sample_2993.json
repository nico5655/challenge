    "prob_desc_description": "Consider 2n rows of the seats in a bus. n rows of the seats on the left and n rows of the seats on the right. Each row can be filled by two people. So the total capacity of the bus is 4n.Consider that m (m ≤ 4n) people occupy the seats in the bus. The passengers entering the bus are numbered from 1 to m (in the order of their entering the bus). The pattern of the seat occupation is as below:1-st row left window seat, 1-st row right window seat, 2-nd row left window seat, 2-nd row right window seat, ... , n-th row left window seat, n-th row right window seat.After occupying all the window seats (for m &gt; 2n) the non-window seats are occupied:1-st row left non-window seat, 1-st row right non-window seat, ... , n-th row left non-window seat, n-th row right non-window seat.All the passengers go to a single final destination. In the final destination, the passengers get off in the given order.1-st row left non-window seat, 1-st row left window seat, 1-st row right non-window seat, 1-st row right window seat, ... , n-th row left non-window seat, n-th row left window seat, n-th row right non-window seat, n-th row right window seat.  The seating for n = 9 and m = 36. You are given the values n and m. Output m numbers from 1 to m, the order in which the passengers will get off the bus.",
