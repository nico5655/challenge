For example, if $$$p$$$ is aba, and $$$s$$$ is de, then the following outcomes are possible (the character we erase from $$$p$$$ and insert into $$$s$$$ is highlighted):  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ ba, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ ade;  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ ba, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ dae;  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ ba, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ dea;  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ aa, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ bde;  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ aa, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ dbe;  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ aa, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ deb;  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ ab, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ ade;  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ ab, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ dae;  aba $$$\\rightarrow$$$ ab, de $$$\\rightarrow$$$ dea; Your goal is to perform several (maybe zero) operations so that $$$s$$$ becomes equal to $$$t$$$.
