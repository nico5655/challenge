This way the sum in each group is 5, and the absolute difference is 0.In the second example there are only two integers, and since both groups should be non-empty, you have to put one integer in the first group and one in the second. This way the absolute difference of sums of integers in each group is 1.",

He wants to split these integers in two non-empty groups in such a way that the absolute difference of sums of integers in each group is as small as possible. Help Petya to split the integers. Each of n integers should be exactly in one group.",
