    "prob_desc_description": "Miyako came to the flea kingdom with a ukulele. She became good friends with local flea residents and played beautiful music for them every day.In return, the fleas made a bigger ukulele for her: it has $$$n$$$ strings, and each string has $$$(10^{18} + 1)$$$ frets numerated from $$$0$$$ to $$$10^{18}$$$. The fleas use the array $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$ to describe the ukulele's tuning, that is, the pitch of the $$$j$$$-th fret on the $$$i$$$-th string is the integer $$$s_i + j$$$.Miyako is about to leave the kingdom, but the fleas hope that Miyako will answer some last questions for them.Each question is in the form of: \"How many different pitches are there, if we consider frets between $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ (inclusive) on all strings?\"Miyako is about to visit the cricket kingdom and has no time to answer all the questions. Please help her with this task!Formally, you are given a matrix with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$(10^{18}+1)$$$ columns, where the cell in the $$$i$$$-th row and $$$j$$$-th column ($$$0 \\le j \\le 10^{18}$$$) contains the integer $$$s_i + j$$$. You are to answer $$$q$$$ queries, in the $$$k$$$-th query you have to answer the number of distinct integers in the matrix from the $$$l_k$$$-th to the $$$r_k$$$-th columns, inclusive.",
