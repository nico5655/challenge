    "prob_desc_description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$n$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.A forest is an undirected graph without cycles (not necessarily connected).Mocha and Diana are friends in Zhijiang, both of them have a forest with nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and they would like to add edges to their forests such that:   After adding edges, both of their graphs are still forests.  They add the same edges. That is, if an edge $$$(u, v)$$$ is added to Mocha's forest, then an edge $$$(u, v)$$$ is added to Diana's forest, and vice versa. Mocha and Diana want to know the maximum number of edges they can add, and which edges to add.",

Each of the next $$$h$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$) — the edge you add each time. If there are multiple correct answers, you can print any one of them.",

Each of the next $$$m_1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le u, v \\le n$$$, $$$u \\neq v$$$) — the edges in Mocha's forest.
