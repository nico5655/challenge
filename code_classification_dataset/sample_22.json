    "prob_desc_description": "Daniel has a string s, consisting of lowercase English letters and period signs (characters '.'). Let's define the operation of replacement as the following sequence of steps: find a substring \"..\" (two consecutive periods) in string s, of all occurrences of the substring let's choose the first one, and replace this substring with string \".\". In other words, during the replacement operation, the first two consecutive periods are replaced by one. If string s contains no two consecutive periods, then nothing happens.Let's define f(s) as the minimum number of operations of replacement to perform, so that the string does not have any two consecutive periods left.You need to process m queries, the i-th results in that the character at position xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ n) of string s is assigned value ci. After each operation you have to calculate and output the value of f(s).Help Daniel to process all queries.",

The i-th line contains integer xi and ci (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, ci — a lowercas English letter or a period sign), describing the query of assigning symbol ci to position xi.",
