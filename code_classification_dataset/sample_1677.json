",
    "prob_desc_description": "Stepan had a favorite string s which consisted of the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. After graduation, he decided to remember it, but it was a long time ago, so he can't now remember it. But Stepan remembers some information about the string, namely the sequence of integers c1, c2, ..., cn, where n equals the length of the string s, and ci equals the number of substrings in the string s with the length i, consisting of the same letters. The substring is a sequence of consecutive characters in the string s.For example, if the Stepan's favorite string is equal to \"tttesst\", the sequence c looks like: c = [7, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0].Stepan asks you to help to repair his favorite string s according to the given sequence c1, c2, ..., cn.
