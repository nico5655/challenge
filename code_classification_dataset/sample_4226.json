How many maximum teams can be made if:  each team must consist of exactly $$$4$$$ students,  teams of $$$4$$$ mathematicians or $$$4$$$ programmers are unlikely to perform well, so the decision was made not to compose such teams. Thus, each team must have at least one programmer and at least one mathematician.Print the required maximum number of teams. Each person can be a member of no more than one team.",
