You can get some information about this array using a new device you just ordered on Amazon. This device can answer queries of the following form: in response to the positions of $$$k$$$ different elements of the array, it will return the position and value of the $$$m$$$-th among them in the ascending order.Unfortunately, the instruction for the device was lost during delivery. However, you remember $$$k$$$, but don't remember $$$m$$$. Your task is to find $$$m$$$ using queries to this device. You can ask not more than $$$n$$$ queries.Note that the array $$$a$$$ and number $$$m$$$ are fixed before the start of the interaction and don't depend on your queries. In other words, interactor is not adaptive.Note that you don't have to minimize the number of queries, and you don't need to guess array $$$a$$$. You just have to guess $$$m$$$.",
