Let's assume that positions in the line are indexed from left to right by numbers from 1 to n + m. Then the number of integers i (1 ≤ i &lt; n + m) such that positions with indexes i and i + 1 contain children of different genders (position i has a girl and position i + 1 has a boy or vice versa) must be as large as possible. Help the children and tell them how to form the line.",
