The castle of the $$$i$$$-th bridegroom is located at the distance $$$a_i$$$ from the capital in clockwise direction, and the palace of the $$$i$$$-th bride is located at the distance $$$b_i$$$ from the capital in clockwise direction.Let's define the inconvenience of a marriage the maximum distance that some bride should walk along the circle from her palace to her bridegroom's castle in the shortest direction (in clockwise or counter-clockwise direction).Help the bridegrooms of Ringland to choose brides in such a way that the inconvenience of the marriage is the smallest possible.",
