But, by flipping the first element, the array becomes $$${1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0}$$$, which has the inversions formed by the pairs of indices ($$$1, 3$$$), ($$$1, 4$$$), ($$$1, 6$$$), ($$$2, 3$$$), ($$$2, 4$$$), ($$$2, 6$$$), ($$$5, 6$$$) which total to $$$7$$$ inversions which is the maximum possible.",
