However, the ancient repository containing this priceless Willow light did not want to open!Ori was taken aback, but the Voice of the Forest explained to him that the cunning Gorleks had decided to add protection to the repository.The Gorleks were very fond of the \"string expansion\" operation. They were also very fond of increasing subsequences.Suppose a string $$$s_1s_2s_3 \\ldots s_n$$$ is given. Then its \"expansion\" is defined as the sequence of strings $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_1 s_2$$$, ..., $$$s_1 s_2 \\ldots s_n$$$, $$$s_2$$$, $$$s_2 s_3$$$, ..., $$$s_2 s_3 \\ldots s_n$$$, $$$s_3$$$, $$$s_3 s_4$$$, ..., $$$s_{n-1} s_n$$$, $$$s_n$$$. For example, the \"expansion\" the string 'abcd' will be the following sequence of strings: 'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'abcd', 'b', 'bc', 'bcd', 'c', 'cd', 'd'. To open the ancient repository, Ori must find the size of the largest increasing subsequence of the \"expansion\" of the string $$$s$$$. Here, strings are compared lexicographically.Help Ori with this task!A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \\ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.",

The second line of each test case contains a non-empty string of length $$$n$$$, which consists of lowercase latin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.",
