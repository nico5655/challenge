    "prob_desc_notes": "NoteIn the first test case, Vasya sees the second cell of each row as the same because the second cell of the first row is green and the second cell of the second row is blue, so he can't distinguish these two cells. The rest of the rows are equal in colour. Therefore, Vasya will say that the two rows are coloured the same, even though they aren't.In the second test case, Vasya can see that the two rows are different.In the third test case, every cell is green or blue, so Vasya will think they are the same.",

    "prob_desc_output_spec": "For each test case, output \"YES\" if Vasya considers the grid's two rows to be identical, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).",
