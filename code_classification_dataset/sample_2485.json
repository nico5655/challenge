What is the lexicographically minimum possible string you can obtain from the given one if you can perform no more than $$$k$$$ moves? It is possible that you do not perform any moves at all.Note that you can swap the same pair of adjacent characters with indices $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times. Each such swap is considered a separate move.You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent test cases.",

The second line of the test case contains one string consisting of $$$n$$$ characters '0' and '1'.
