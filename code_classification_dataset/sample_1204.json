Formally, for each given string $$$a_i$$$, there is no more than one position $$$j$$$ such that $$$a_i[j] \\ne s[j]$$$.Note that the desired string $$$s$$$ may be equal to one of the given strings $$$a_i$$$, or it may differ from all the given strings.For example, if you have the strings abac and zbab, then the answer to the problem might be the string abab, which differs from the first only by the last character, and from the second only by the first.",
