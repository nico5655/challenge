She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly $$$H$$$ centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of $$$L$$$ centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface.  Suppose that the lily grows at some point $$$A$$$ on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point $$$A$$$. Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point $$$A$$$, i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point $$$A$$$?",
