    "prob_desc_description": "Another Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered $$$n$$$ participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant $$$i$$$ is $$$a_i$$$. These rating changes are perfectly balanced — their sum is equal to $$$0$$$.Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared semi-rated. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.There are two conditions though:   For each participant $$$i$$$, their modified rating change $$$b_i$$$ must be integer, and as close to $$$\\frac{a_i}{2}$$$ as possible. It means that either $$$b_i = \\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{2} \\rfloor$$$ or $$$b_i = \\lceil \\frac{a_i}{2} \\rceil$$$. In particular, if $$$a_i$$$ is even, $$$b_i = \\frac{a_i}{2}$$$. Here $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than $$$x$$$, and $$$\\lceil x \\rceil$$$ denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than $$$x$$$.  The modified rating changes must be perfectly balanced — their sum must be equal to $$$0$$$. Can you help with that?",
